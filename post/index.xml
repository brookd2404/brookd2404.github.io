      <description>I have been working on a project at the company I work for, and up to this point we have been primarily focused on getting new devices imported and deploying via Autopilot.

      <description>What can you use an Azure App Registration for An Azure App Registration has many uses, in my case I use it mainly for the Microsoft Graph API to perform Intune Configuration Profile backups, List devices, Update local CMDB dynamically and also enrol devices into Autopilot.</description>

      <description>SO&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve been working tirelessly in trying to get an Autopilot Hybrid Deployment working along with my colleagues.
