However, some organisations still look to take migrate their complex Group Policies.\nI would recommend taking the approach of clean slate, aligned to relevant framework(s) such as NCSC, NIST or CIS and applying only relevant policies there after. CIS: CIS Critical Security Controls Cloud Companion Guide (cisecurity.org) NCSC: Windows - NCSC.GOV.UK NIST: NATIONAL CHECKLIST PROGRAM\nThis post is to aid any IT Administrator in achieving goals, weather that be to analyse your current policies or only a selection of polices. There will be a script to export the Group Policies from a specific OU, and a script to recursively import the XML files to Intune utilising the Graph API.\nThe scripts detailed in this post are available on GitHub.\nGetting Started Permissions Intune One of the following permissions is required to use Group Policy Analytics.\nIntune Administrator Any role that includes the Security Baseline permission Group Policy This article assumes the Administrator has access to read and export the GPOs within the targeted scope. The export script will need to be run on an endpoint with Group Policy Management Tools Installed Running the Script(s) All scripts will need to be run with the Execution Policy of the PowerShell terminal set to bypass. If preferred, scripts can be launched prefixed with the below;\npowershell.exe -exectutionpolicy Bypass -File\nExport Group Policies This script is used to export Group Policy Objects using PowerShell. When executing the script you will need to specify which OU ( -OU ) you want to export the policies from and also the folder ( -GPOFolder ) where you want the exports to be stored.\nThe script is extensible, so if you want to widen the scope or make amendments, make it work for you.\nIf you execute the script with a command like below, you will see the policy GUIDs that are exported as displayed in the clip.\n\u0026quot;\u0026lt;Path\u0026gt;\\Get-LinkedGPOs.ps1\u0026quot; -OU \u0026quot;OU=Managed_Devices,DC=Domain,DC=LAB\u0026quot; -GPOFolder \u0026quot;$env:SystemDrive\\Temp\\GPOs\u0026quot;\nImporting Group Policies to Group Policy Analytics Importing the policy exports to Group Policy Analytics is just as simple as exporting them with the use of the Import-GroupPolicyAnalyticsPolicy.ps1 script. This script was designed for a specific purpose, to save time and clicks!.\nFor this example, we will start by taking a look at some of the parameters that are used upon launch.\nGPOFolder (Mandatory): This parameter is to be used to point the script to your .XML files. Recurse: If you have group policies nested inside other folders, this parameter is advised to recursively import them. LogOutputLocation: A location for the created logfile output, default is C:\\Temp. TenantID: If you are calling this script for any other tenant, other than the one you have previously logged into, you will need to specify the TenantID. UseDeviceAuthentication: Offers the ability to use Device Authentication. This script will only import Group Policies with Unique names, it does a check on the names prior to import.\nOnce you are ready, you can execute the script with the relevant parameters, for example you can run the following command to import the policies.\n\u0026quot;\u0026lt;Path\u0026gt;\\Import-GroupPolicyAnalyticsPolicy.ps1.ps1\u0026quot; -GPOFolder \u0026quot;$env:SystemDrive\\Temp\\GPOs\u0026quot; -UseDeviceAuthentication\nResults This results in the Group Policy being available within Intune, as below;\nConclusion This was a quite good to pull together, I hope you can put it to good use and make your life a lot easier and less pain staking.\nPlease leave feedback and comments below if you would like to see more things like this.\nFurther Reading For further reading on Group Policy Analytics, please review the Microsoft Documentation\n","image":"https://euc365.com/images/post/grouppolicy/gpoAnalytics_hu0d1abe62d3af20e61022459fc5af455f_70449_460x200_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://euc365.com/post/import-gpos-group-policy-analytics-graph-api/","tags":["Graph API","Intune","PowerShell","Group Policy"],"title":"Import GPOs to Group Policy Analytics using Graph API"},{"categories":["Graph API","PowerShell","Microsoft Intune"],"contents":"Often, during the initial adoption of Microsoft Intune you will see organisations and admins try and maintain some of their technical debt of old. One of those areas is often the device naming conventions. In the modern management world, tracking assets via this method is long out dated, and if you are using Hybrid Azure AD Joined Devices you end up with an entirely new challenge on your hands anyway.\nThis post is aimed at organisations and admins who have decided to remove some of this technical debt and move towards using the options available within the Deployment Profiles for Autopilot.\nIn this post we will be using a PowerShell Script with the Microsoft.Graph module to achieve our goal and also take a backup of the devices previously specified DisplayNames.\nYou can obtain the script we will use from my Git Repo by using the link below.\nAssumptions and Getting Started The current script will remove ALL Display Names from devices within your tenant, by all means customise the logic to ensure this only handles devices in an array etc, but my need was to remove this from the entire fleet of devices on a tenant.\nAn assumption is made that you have devices that devices have the following value set on their Autopilot entity.\nThere is also an Assumption that you have the relevant rights to perform this action and also grant application consent to run the PowerShell script.\nRunning the Script This part is fairly simple, however you will need to run this under a PowerShell session that is at least in bypass mode. My recommendation instead of changing the execution policy for PowerShell in its entirety is to run it with the following command in an elevated PowerShell prompt.\npowershell.exe -executionpolicy Bypass -File \u0026quot;\u0026lt;Path\u0026gt;\\Remove-AutopilotDisplayNameProperty.ps1\u0026quot; -LogOutputLocation \u0026quot;$env:ProgramData\\Logs\u0026quot;\nOnce the script has complete you will have a log created in your specified location which will look something like this.\nConclusion I hope this script can prove useful to you, your peers and also your organisation.

Often users and admins get frustrated when it comes to resetting passwords, \u0026ldquo;Can you try Bf756dsgT!\u0026rdquo; Short Pause\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;Is that F for foxtrot or S for sugar?\u0026rdquo;. Once you get past this stage, the user then has to type it again and then think of a new password, the whole process is just sub-optimal.\nWith today\u0026rsquo;s cloud infrastructure you can relieve both end users and also admins from this stress and also streamline the process with Self-Service Password Reset or SSPR for short. I am not going to tell you that this is a silver bullet with one shot clearing out all password reset calls, as it won\u0026rsquo;t. The key to the success of SSPR and the ROI is stakeholder buy-in and great communication.\nI have seen SSPR used each time a user needs to update their password. This is due to focusing on a Passwordless strategy, which provides a more secure method of authentication. If this is a goal for you, then this may be a piece in your puzzle!\nFor those of you awesome ladies and gentlemen that follow me on twitter, or have seen my recent VLOGs you may have seen that I blew my entire lab away and started a fresh, with the aim of blogging/vlogging/tweeting about elements of the rebuild along the way.\nThis time around, I chose to use Cloud Sync as my gateway to hybrid identities as it is lightweight, provides a more seamless High-Availability offering and fits perfectly for what I want to achieve, so this will be the area in which we focus on in this post for SSPR.\nPre-Requisites Azure AD tenant with at least an Azure AD Premium P1 or trial license enabled. If needed, create one for free. Global Administrator Account Azure AD Connect cloud sync version 1.1.972.0 or later Configuring SSPR Enable Self-Service Password Reset This may seem an obvious step, but I have often seen it missed.\nHead over to the Azure Active Directory Portal Click Azure Active Directory in the left-hand pane Click Password Reset On the Properties page you will see the below options, ensure you configure this to suit your organisational needs, for this Lab I will be setting it to All. Once you have made your selection, click Save.\nConfigure On-Premise Integration On the assumption that you are still on the Password Reset blade from the above section.\nClick on On-premises integration Select Enable password write back for synced users Select Write back password with Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync Click Save Personally, I would leave the Allow users to Unlock accounts without resetting their passwords un-selected, but this would be a decision you can take away to discuss with peers and the organisation.\nPowerShell You can also use powershell to configure Password Writeback, however, when using PowerShell to complete this you will not see it visually in the Azure Portal (or at least your couldn\u0026rsquo;t at the time of publishing this article).\nLogon to the Server hosting the Agent Launch an Administrative PowerShell Prompt Run the following commands; Import-Module 'C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Microsoft Azure AD Connect Provisioning Agent\\\\Microsoft.CloudSync.Powershell.dll' Set-AADCloudSyncPasswordWritebackConfiguration -Enable $true -Credential $(Get-Credential) Enter your Global Administrator credentials Using SSPR Using SSPR is super simple, all the user has to do it browse to https://aka.ms/sspr and enter their username, complete the captcha and then follow the prompts to use one (or two) of their chosen security methods and then they can enter a new password.\nThe whole process takes about 1-2 minutes. This is often quicker than the wait in the queue for a support staff call.\nIf you notice that after completing the configuration that when attempting SSPR you receive error SSPR_010, try turning SSPR off and on again (Yes!! Really!!).\nThank you to Maurice Daly for his input on this one!! I was searching for a mountain and missing a mole hill.

Using API\u0026rsquo;s and Automation accounts help create a continuously repeatable process whilst minimising human error and providing a consistent experience. It has many purposes, should that be to provide a script to a managed client, create a team from a form submission, the list could go on, and If you\u0026rsquo;ve found this post by organic search, then it must be at least in some way what your are looking for.\nSo how do we do it? This guide will focus on using PowerShell to call the Graph API using the Microsoft.Graph module. However, the key take away is that this can be achieve via alternative API calling methods.\nWhat will we be deploying? We will look at deploying a Microsoft Team, with an additional channel, whist also removing Tabs from the channels and adding custom tabs for Web Links.\nPre-requisites Microsoft.Graph PowerShell Module Teams Administrator (or equivalent/higher) privileges Building up the channel Object Before we can POST anything to the Graph API, we need to start by building up our Team and channels. In the drop down below, there is a sample of the $params object which will later be used to create a Team. We will be referencing back to this throughout this section.\nTeam Object $params = @{ \u0026#34;Template@odata.bind\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/teamsTemplates(\u0026#39;standard\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; Visibility = \u0026#34;Private\u0026#34; DisplayName = $TeamName Description = \u0026#34;This Teams Channel will be used for collaboration.\u0026#34; Channels = @( @{ DisplayName = \u0026#34;General\u0026#34; IsFavoriteByDefault = $true Description = \u0026#34;This channel will be used for communication purposes\u0026#34; Tabs = @( @{ \u0026#34;TeamsApp@odata.bind\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/appCatalogs/teamsApps(\u0026#39;com.microsoft.teamspace.tab.web\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; DisplayName = \u0026#34;Microsoft Intune\u0026#34; Configuration = @{ ContentUrl = \u0026#34;https://endpoint.microsoft.com\u0026#34; } } ) }, @{ DisplayName = \u0026#34;Service Announcements\u0026#34; IsFavoriteByDefault = $true Description = \u0026#34;This tab will be used for things like Third Party Patching and other Service Related Alerts\u0026#34; } ) MemberSettings = @{ AllowCreateUpdateChannels = $true AllowDeleteChannels = $true AllowAddRemoveApps = $true AllowCreateUpdateRemoveTabs = $true AllowCreateUpdateRemoveConnectors = $true } GuestSettings = @{ AllowCreateUpdateChannels = $true AllowDeleteChannels = $true } FunSettings = @{ AllowGiphy = $true AllowStickersAndMemes = $true AllowCustomMemes = $true } MessagingSettings = @{ AllowUserEditMessages = $true AllowUserDeleteMessages = $true AllowOwnerDeleteMessages = $true AllowTeamMentions = $true AllowChannelMentions = $true } DiscoverySettings = @{ ShowInTeamsSearchAndSuggestions = $true } InstalledApps = @( @{ \u0026#34;TeamsApp@odata.bind\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/appCatalogs/teamsApps(\u0026#39;com.microsoft.teamspace.tab.web\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; } @{ #The invoke webhook \u0026#34;TeamsApp@odata.bind\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/appCatalogs/teamsApps(\u0026#39;203a1e2c-26cc-47ca-83ae-be98f960b6b2\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; } ) } So lets look at some of the main properties;\n\u0026ldquo;Template@odata.bind\u0026rdquo; - This is teams template you want to base your channel on. This can be a custom channel, or an in-built one. CLICK HERE: Other Inbuilt Template Types CLICK HERE: For information on custom templates Visibility - You\u0026rsquo;re channel visibility, either public or private. DisplayName - The display name of the Team you want to create Description - A brief description of the purpose of this team. Channels - The channels you want to create within the Team. There are other options within the object, which are comparable to their GUI counterparts, I have left them in the object to allow the ease of updating these values if you need to change them.\nChannels Let us explore the channel array a bit further, this is where you create additional channels within the team. This is also the section you will add in any custom tabs you may want to add as demonstrated within the object.\nEach channel will be an object within the channel array, and as before, there are some basic properties like DisplayName and Description, then you have the IsFavouriteByDefault property, this is what controls if the channel is displayed or hidden upon creation based on a boolean input. Then you have Tabs, where you can add apps.\nYou can find the Apps available to add to this array by calling the TeamsApp API. An example query would be GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/appCatalogs/teamsApps?$expand=appDefinitions($select=id,displayName,allowedInstallationScopes). Using this query you could find the app IDs.\nMy recommendation for this would be to export a template that already has the application within it and obtain the values you need to ensure you enrich the app properly with configurations, alternatively seek these configuration values from the app vendor.\nAll of the apps within thr array are defined as objects as with the channels. If we look at the below object as an , you can see the teams app is bound to a URL similar to the one above. Followed by a DisplayName and the Configuration for the App. In the below example I will be creating a Tab for the Microsoft Intune Console.\n@{ \u0026#34;TeamsApp@odata.bind\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/appCatalogs/teamsApps(\u0026#39;com.microsoft.teamspace.tab.web\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; DisplayName = \u0026#34;Microsoft Intune\u0026#34; Configuration = @{ ContentUrl = \u0026#34;https://endpoint.microsoft.com\u0026#34; } } If you prefer to use the direct api with a JSON object from Graph Explorer or PostMan you can use the following command to convert your object to JSON.\n$params | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5\nNOTE: MAKE SURE YOU FILL OUT YOUR VARIABLES WHERE THEY ARE CALLED WITHIN THE OBJECT\nOK, so now we\u0026rsquo;ve explored the channels, lets explore how we POST it to the Graph API with PowerShell.\nCreate the Team with PowerShell One thing I found when creating the Team via the Graph API, is that you will only receive a success status code when posting the object to the Graph. This is because the API is more like an orchestrator, which means we need to do some additional bits to track the creation. This is more of a requirement if you want to amend the team after creation, for things like removing the Wiki tab etc, which will all be described in the following sections.\nAs mentioned in the Pre-requisites, we will need the Microsoft.Graph PowerShell module, you can install this by running Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Graph -AllowClobber in an elevated shell, or append with -Scope CurrentUser from a non-elevated prompt.\nPowerShell Script Example [CmdletBinding()] param ( [Parameter(DontShow = $true)] [Array] $ModuleNames = @(\u0026#34;Microsoft.Graph.Teams\u0026#34;), # Teams Channel Name [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)] [String] $TeamName ) #TeamsAdmin and Groups admin Required FOREACH ($Module in $ModuleNames) { IF (!(Get-Module -ListAvailable -Name $Module)) { try { Write-Output \u0026#34;Attempting to install $Module Module for the Current Device\u0026#34; Install-Module -Name $Module -Force -AllowClobber } catch { Write-Output \u0026#34;Attempting to install $Module Module for the Current User\u0026#34; Install-Module -Name $Module -Force -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser } } Import-Module $Module } $params = @{ \u0026#34;Template@odata.bind\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/teamsTemplates(\u0026#39;standard\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; Visibility = \u0026#34;Private\u0026#34; DisplayName = $TeamName Description = \u0026#34;This Teams Channel will be used for collaboration.\u0026#34; Channels = @( @{ DisplayName = \u0026#34;General\u0026#34; IsFavoriteByDefault = $true Description = \u0026#34;This channel will be used for communication purposes\u0026#34; Tabs = @( @{ \u0026#34;TeamsApp@odata.bind\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/appCatalogs/teamsApps(\u0026#39;com.microsoft.teamspace.tab.web\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; DisplayName = \u0026#34;Microsoft Intune\u0026#34; Configuration = @{ ContentUrl = \u0026#34;https://endpoint.microsoft.com\u0026#34; } } ) }, @{ DisplayName = \u0026#34;Service Announcements\u0026#34; IsFavoriteByDefault = $true Description = \u0026#34;This tab will be used for things like Third Party Patching and other Service Related Alerts\u0026#34; } ) MemberSettings = @{ AllowCreateUpdateChannels = $true AllowDeleteChannels = $true AllowAddRemoveApps = $true AllowCreateUpdateRemoveTabs = $true AllowCreateUpdateRemoveConnectors = $true } GuestSettings = @{ AllowCreateUpdateChannels = $true AllowDeleteChannels = $true } FunSettings = @{ AllowGiphy = $true AllowStickersAndMemes = $true AllowCustomMemes = $true } MessagingSettings = @{ AllowUserEditMessages = $true AllowUserDeleteMessages = $true AllowOwnerDeleteMessages = $true AllowTeamMentions = $true AllowChannelMentions = $true } DiscoverySettings = @{ ShowInTeamsSearchAndSuggestions = $true } InstalledApps = @( @{ \u0026#34;TeamsApp@odata.bind\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/appCatalogs/teamsApps(\u0026#39;com.microsoft.teamspace.tab.web\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; } @{ #The invoke webhook \u0026#34;TeamsApp@odata.bind\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/appCatalogs/teamsApps(\u0026#39;203a1e2c-26cc-47ca-83ae-be98f960b6b2\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; } ) } Connect-MgGraph $Team = Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Uri \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/teams\u0026#34; -Body $params -Method POST -OutputType HttpResponseMessage #Wait while the team is created, this below link tracks the job. while ((Invoke-MGGraphRequest -URI \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/beta$($Team.Headers.Location.OriginalString)\u0026#34;).status -ne \u0026#34;succeeded\u0026#34;) { Start-Sleep 60 \u0026#34;Awaiting the team creation to complete...\u0026#34; } In the above drop-down you will see an example script, which contains the same object we have been working on previously in this post, so if you have started making your own object, simply replace the object in the example script.\nIn this section we will focus on everything after the object and then how the script can be invoked from the command line using parameters.\nThe first thing that we need to do is authenticate to the Microsoft Graph, we use the Connect-MgGraph command for this when using direct execution, for automation scenarios, please review the Microsoft Documentation.\nOnce we have authenticated, We use the Invoke-MGGraphRequest to POST the param object to the Graph API. In this example, we assign this call to the $Team variable so we can then track the team creation.\nAfter the initial POST to the API, the example then use a while loop to track the creation of the team. As mentioned in the tip at the start of this section, the API call to create the team is more of an orchestration API which is the reason we need to go to the additional effort to track the progress of creation.\n#Wait while the team is created, this below link tracks the job. while ((Invoke-MGGraphRequest -URI \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/beta$($Team.Headers.Location.OriginalString)\u0026#34;).status -ne \u0026#34;succeeded\u0026#34;) { Start-Sleep 60 \u0026#34;Awaiting the team creation to complete...\u0026#34; } Once the operation has succeeded, you can then layer on additional customisations, such as removing the Wiki tab as shown in the example below.\n#Get the Teams ID from the Output of the header $TeamID = (Select-String -Pattern \u0026#34;\\\u0026#39;([^\\\u0026#39;]*)\\\u0026#39;\u0026#34; -InputObject $Team.Content.Headers.ContentLocation.OriginalString).Matches.Groups[1].Value #Get the Teams Channels for the new Team $TeamChannels = Get-MgTeamChannel -TeamId $TeamID #For Each of the Channels, remove the Wiki Tab and ensure they are all set to show by default ForEach ($Channel in $TeamChannels) { $wikiTab = (Get-MgTeamChannelTab -ChannelId $Channel.id -TeamId $TeamID | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -eq \u0026#34;Wiki\u0026#34;}).id Remove-MGTeamChannelTab -TeamId $TeamID -ChannelID $Channel.id -TeamsTabId $wikiTab Update-MGTeamChannel -TeamId $TeamID -ChannelID $Channel.id -IsFavoriteByDefault } Conclusion As mentioned at the start, automation is the key to consistency when performing repetitive tasks. Hopefully this post can aid with the understanding of how to achieve and automated approach to creating Teams and Channels within your organisation.\nResources Teams Resource Beta Graph Reference Microsoft Graph PowerShell Module Documentation Inbuilt Template Types Custom Templates ","image":"https://euc365.com/images/post/teams/TeamsGraphFeaturedImage_hu6d0b03eee463f0955841d4d27954408c_23636_460x200_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://euc365.com/post/create-a-microsoft-team-with-graph-api-powershell/","tags":["Graph API","PowerShell","Teams","Microsoft Graph Module"],"title":"Create a Microsoft Team with Graph API and PowerShell"},{"categories":["Bicep","Azure Resource Manager"],"contents":"What is Bicep?

Sometimes it can be a struggle for other colleagues/teams to reverse engineer your complex templates. So you decide to take a look at Bicep to help make them more consumable to your colleagues and team members.\nWell, Microsoft and the Bicep team could not have made this simpler to achieve!. Using the Bicep command line tools, you can easily decompile (convert) your standard json template to Bicep\u0026hellip; and the best bit, your json template file (if used) still works seamlessly.\nPre-requisites I will be be using a Windows Client and VSCode for this post, using a different setup, your experience may differ.\nPlease visit the Install Bicep tools page to install the Bicep tools.\nDecompile an ARM Template This really couldn\u0026rsquo;t be any simpler, but just for the sake of completeness before you see the warning anyway, the decompilation of the templates is on a best efforts basis, if your template does not decompile then you can raise an issue on the link provided in your shell.\nOpen VSCode to the directory where your templates are stored Type bicep decompile Review the output of the file The output file will be located in the same directory as the original file, but with a bicep extension. You can specify the output directory (which will need to exist first) by using the \u0026ndash;outdir parameter, or you can specify the file name but using the \u0026ndash;outfile parameter.\nYou can not specify both \u0026ndash;outdir and \u0026ndash;outfile together.\nCompile and ARM Template from Bicep Again, this is relatively straightforward. My biggest use case for this at the moment is when I want to publish a Deploy to Azure Button as this still requires a JSON template to be passed in.\nOpen VSCode to the directory where your templates are stored Type bicep build Review the output of the file The output file will be located in the same directory as the original file, but with a JSON extension. You can specify the output directory (which will need to exist first) by using the \u0026ndash;outdir parameter, or you can specify the file name but using the \u0026ndash;outfile parameter.\nYou can not specify both \u0026ndash;outdir and \u0026ndash;outfile together.\nConclusion I enjoyed learning about Bicep over the course of a weekend, and going forward it will be my chosen language to be building template files for Azure as its so much easier than ARM templates for others to read.\nWhy not start your journey using some of the resources below.\nWatch out for more Bicep and ARM posts coming soon.\nResources Bicep Documentation Bicep Microsoft Learn Modules Bicep with Pipelines ","image":"https://euc365.com/images/post/azure/FeaturedImage_hub0c9b0557b7c4046bd893566db26fc3c_36499_460x200_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://euc365.com/post/use-bicep-to-compile-or-decompile-arm-templates/","tags":["Infrastructure as Code","Bicep","ARM"],"title":"Use Bicep to Compile or Decompile ARM Templates"},{"categories":["Azure","Governance"],"contents":"What is Azure Policy? Azure Policy is a way to help organisations enforce standards and compliance. Azure Policy is commonly used for things like enforcing only certain allowed locations for resources, locating non-compliant Azure resources and for many, many other reasons.\nFor a full overview of Azure Policy, please take a look at the Microsoft Documentation.\nWhy would you want to deny resource creation? There could be many reasons, such as wanting to prevent the creation of Virtual Machines, Network Security Groups, Storage Accounts, to name a few. A requirement I came up against recently was a client wanted to prevent the creation of New Virtual Machines inside a subscription.\nWhat is the Solution? The solution to the problem is to create an Azure Policy definition and assign it to your Management Group, Subscription or to a specific resource group.\nYou can assign a Policy Definition more than once, it can also be assigned at different levels each time.\nThere are various ways you can create the definition, for example, you can hardcore your parameters, you can make use of Azure strongTypes and have a drop down menu to select your resource types or you can simply apply them in an anyOf array, see the different definition snippets, along with their assignment experiences in the drop-downs below.\nanyOf Array { \u0026#34;mode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;All\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;policyRule\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;if\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;anyOf\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;field\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;equals\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;field\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;like\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Microsoft.Network*\u0026#34; } ] }, \u0026#34;then\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;deny\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;parameters\u0026#34;: {} } Assignment Experience Hardcoded Array { \u0026#34;mode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;All\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;policyRule\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;if\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;anyOf\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;field\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;in\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;[parameters(\u0026#39;deniedResouces\u0026#39;)]\u0026#34; } ] }, \u0026#34;then\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;deny\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;parameters\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;deniedResouces\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Array\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;metadata\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;displayName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Denied Resources\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;The list of resources that are denied for creation.\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;allowedValues\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;Microsoft.Compute/VirtualMachines\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets\u0026#34; ] } } } Assignment Experience Azure Resource Drop-down (strongType) { \u0026#34;mode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;All\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;policyRule\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;if\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;anyOf\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;field\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;in\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;[parameters(\u0026#39;deniedResouces\u0026#39;)]\u0026#34; } ] }, \u0026#34;then\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;deny\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;parameters\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;deniedResouces\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Array\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;metadata\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;displayName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Denied Resources\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;The list of resources that are denied for creation.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;strongType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;resourceTypes\u0026#34; } } } } Assignment Experience Create an Azure Policy Definition Browse to the Azure Portal\nUse the search bar and locate Policy\nSelect Definitions from the left-hand pane\nClick + Policy definition\nEnter the following details;\nSelect your desired definition location Enter a descriptive name Add a description Select or Create a new category for your definition to live within Copy and paste your desired definition snippet from one of the above drop-downs.

You can view the assignment experience within the drop-downs above to see how it behaves depending on your chosen method.\nConclusion The route I would take would be to use the strongType list and name the definition something along the lines of \u0026lt;COMPANY SHORTCODE\u0026gt;-Deny Resource Types. This will allow you to use a single definition to define which resources to deny in different Subscriptions, Management Groups or Resource Groups.\nResouces Azure Policy Documentation Azure Policy definition structure ","image":"https://euc365.com/images/post/azurepolicy/mainicon_hu63a42c266a2c7f414152444b4ea2c821_3847_460x200_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://euc365.com/post/deny-resource-type-creation-azure-policy/","tags":["Compliance","Azure Policy"],"title":"Deny Resource Type Creation with Azure Policy"},{"categories":["Samsung Knox","Microsoft Intune","Mobile Device Management"],"contents":"Why disable MAC Randomization? In some scenarios setting static IP Addresses for mobile devices is a requirement (such as EPOS, Kiosks, Meeting Room Self-Service Tablets etc.). With most modern Mobile Devices, they are shipped with MAC Randomization enabled by default, and that is certainly the case for Samsung Tablets.\nThis was introduced back in Android 8.0 when probing for new networks, however, starting in Android 10 this was enabled by default for client mode activities as mentioned in the Android Documentation.\nMAC randomization prevents listeners from using MAC addresses to build a history of device activity, thus increasing user privacy.\n-Samsung Documentation What is the solution? The solution is to use the Knox Service Plugin from Samsung, coupled with an Intune OEM Configuration profile. By using both of these elements you can control various aspects of the device configuration, however, we are only going to to cover MAC Randomization.\nMyself and my colleague have seen issues with this when using Certificate Authentication for your WiFi. That is not to say it will not work, you will have to configure the Knox Service Plugin to connect to your network with certificate. For this post I will be focusing on the core configuration and a WPA2 network.\nPre-requisites To have the ability to disable MAC Randomization on Samsung Devices with Intune you will need the following;\nSamsung Knox Platform for Enterprise Commercial Key Samsung Knox Service Plugin Managed Google Play App Intune Licenses Intune Administrator Role (Custom RBAC Roles are not in scope) If you do not have a Samsung Knox license or account, take a look at my Getting Started with Samsung Knox for Enterprise post.\nImport the Samsung Knox Service Plugin App Browse to Microsoft Intune Select Apps from the left-hand pane, then select Android Select Managed Google Play app from the App type list, then press Select Search Knox Service Plugin, select the app shown below Select Approve, read the permission page, if you are happy click Approve Select Keep approved when app requests new permissions, then click Done Click Sync Allow up to 15 minutes for the application to appear, if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t appear go back to the Managed Google Play Store and click Sync again.\nOnce the application has synced assign this to your devices.\nObtain the commercial key for Knox Login to Samsung Knox Hover over Knox Platform for Enterprise, then click See License Select the Commercial Keys, locate the Knox Platform for Enterprise: Premium Edition key Copy the contents of the License Number field. Creating the OEM Config Profile Browse to Microsoft Intune Select Devices from the left-hand pane, then select Android Select Configuration Profiles Click Create Profile Platform: Android Enterprise Profile Type: OEMConfig Click Create Enter a Name and Descriptions Click Select an OEMConfig app Select Knox Service Plugin, then click Select Configure the following settings: Profile name:: \u0026lt;suitable name for your organization\u0026gt; KPE Premium or Knox Suite License key: The commercial key you obtained in the previous section Debug Mode: I would only change this to true during testing, I would not change this if your devices in production have the KSP installed. Locate Device-wide policies (Selectively applicable to Fully Manage Device (DO) or Work Profile-on company owned devices (WP-C) mode as noted), then click Configure Select true on the Enable device policy controls slider Locate Device customization controls (Premium), then click Configure Select true on the Enable device customization slider In the left-pane select Device-wide policies (Selectively applicable to Fully Manage Device (DO) or Work Profile-on company owned devices (WP-C) mode as noted) Locate Device Controls, then click Configure Locate Wi-Fi Policy, then click Configure and set the following settings Enable Wi-Fi policy controls: true Allow Automatic Wi-Fi Connection to saved SSIDs: true Allow Wi-Fi State Change: true Allow to configure Wi-Fi (Configure details below): true In the left-pane select Knox Service Plugin Locate Wi-Fi Configuration, then click Configure In the left-hand pane click the three ellipses (\u0026hellip;) next to Wi-Fi Configurations, then click Add Setting Enter you network details, then change the Skip Mac randomization slider to true Your Wireless Credentials can be seen in plain text when using a PSK.\nThe policy is not in a state to disable MAC randomization, complete the policy creation and add any scope tags and Assignments on the next pages. Testing Now the policy is created, if you haven\u0026rsquo;t already done so assign this to a group that contains test devices. If you want visibility that the settings have applied properly, change the Debug mode setting to true within your OEMConfig policy.\nYou will also need to assign the Knox Service plugin to the same group as the OEMConfig Profile.\nYou can only assign one KSP profile to a device at any given time.\nOnce you deploy the application and configuration to the device, you will be prompted to to Agree the licence terms first, without doing so the Knox Service Plugin will not function.\nAfter you have agreed the licence terms, launch the Knox Service Plugin app. Press on the Configuration on \u0026hellip;. section, here you will see the configuration applied to your device. If you press on the Configuration results in the top left-hand corner, and then select Policies received you will see the JSON representation of the policy you have defined.\nAs mentioned previously, you will see your PSK in plain text, as shown below.\nYou will not be able to see on the network side, that this device is connecting with the correct MAC Address.\nPlease don\u0026rsquo;t forget to change debug mode to false before a production rollout\nConclusion There are many many things you can do with the Knox Service Plugin, and I have been told by a Samsung Support rep that this can work with a Certificate Based network. However, I do not have the means to test therefore it is not included in this guide.

Samsung Knox is a service made up of a number of solutions such as Knox Mobile Enrollment and Knox Platform for Enterprise. Samsung Knox solutions provide extra security, and configurability and also improve the end-user onboarding experience.\nKnox Mobile Enrollment is Samsung\u0026rsquo;s alternative to Apple Business/School manager for devices. KME offers the ability to upload devices using an app on Samsung devices, or via a vendor/reseller channel.\nOnce devices are onboarded into Samsung Knox you can assign profiles to those devices to integrate with your chosen MDM provider. Using profiles linked to your MDM will vastly improve your onboarding experience for end-users and also secure the device further.\nWhat do I need to get started? Do I need a license? Knox Mobile Enrollment is a free IT solution offered by Samsung and does not require a license key.\n-Samsung As the quote says, no license is required for the KME service. All you need to do is sign up for an account on the Register for Knox page.\nEnter your Work email address, then click Next\nClick Agree\nComplete the information on the Create your Samsung account form, then click Next If you try enter a password longer than 15 characters you will be presented with the above message.\nEnter the Verification Code sent to the e-mail provided, then click Next\nClick Done (Optional, You can at this point choose to configure Multi-factor Authentication, I would recommend doing so, however this is not a requirement.)\nOnce you have returned to the Registration system, click Next\nEnter your Company Information, then click Next\nReview each of the agreements, and if you accept them tick each box (excl. marketing information), then click Submit\nYou will now be taken to the Knox Landing page where you see all of the services that are available through the Knox Platform.

The SLA for this is 48hours (Working Days only). Knox Service Plugin If you plan to use the Knox Service Plugin on your device estate, you will need to Generate a Commercial Key from the Samsung Knox Portal, you can achieve this by doing the following;\nLog into Samsung Knox\nHover over the Knox Platform for Enterprise tile, then click Generate\nTo obtain the key, hover back over the Knox Platform for Enterprise tile, then click See License\nThe Knox Platform for Enterprise: Premium Edition license is the one required for the Knox Service Plugin.\nGetting started with Knox Mobile Enrollment Hover over Knox Mobile Enrollment, select Launch Console Tick Don\u0026rsquo;t show me again, then click Got It Select your services, for this post I will be selecting the following; Click Confirm Knox Mobile Enrollment is now configured, we can now start to take a look at adding devices, creating Profiles and reseller registration.\nManually adding a device To manually add devices to the Knox Mobile Enrollment solution you will need the Knox Deployment app on two devices. The first device being a device you are logged into the Knox Deployment app as an Admin from the Knox solution, and the second a device you wish to import.\nThe device where the Admin is going to be signing in cannot already have an account that is not an Administrator within your Knox solution signed in. If you are, the Knox Deployment app will advise you to log out of your Samsung account and log in with an account which has Knox Deployment permission.\nSamsung has a comprehensive guide on using the Knox Deployment app for enrolling devices. (See: Samsung Knox Deployment App)\nReseller Registration To streamline the process further, you can have your device Resellers import your devices for you. The major benefit of doing this is reducing the time taken by engineers to configure the device ready for enterprise use.\nA list of Resellers can be found using the following link: Resellers | Samsung Knox. Configuring a reseller is simple and can be done so by following Register resellers | Knox Mobile Enrollment.\nCreating a MDM profile for Intune One of the biggest benefits of Knox Mobile Enrollment in an enterprise which uses Intune is the ability to assign a device profile to an enrollment token to remove the need to scan QR codes or enter enrollment tokens. Configuring the profile for this is easy, and in the long run, you will thank yourself for doing it.\nIf you plan to use this for Corporate, Dedicated devices, please note that the Enrollment Token expires after a maximum of 90 days. The enrollment profile within Samsung Knox would need to be updated when the token is renewed.\nObtaining your enrollment token from Intune Login to Microsoft Intune Select Devices in the left-hand pane, then select Android Select Android Enrollment Corporate-owned, fully managed user devices Click Corporate-owned, fully managed user devices (If applicable) Switch the slider to Yes Take a note of the Token above the QR code Corporate-owned dedicated devices Click Corporate-owned dedicated devices Select your desired token Select Token from the left-hand pane, then click Show token Take note of the Token above the QR code Corporate-owned devices with work profile Click Corporate-owned devices with work profile Select your desired token Select Token from the left-hand pane, then click Show token Take note of the Token above the QR code Creating your profile in Samsung Knox Log into Samsung Knox Hover over Knox Mobile Enrollment, select Launch Console Click Profiles from the left-hand pane Click Create Profile in the top right-hand corner Click Android Enterprise Enter a Profile Name and Description In the Pick you MDM drop-down, select Microsoft Intune Leave the rest as default, click Continue Enter {\u0026quot;com.google.android.apps.work.clouddpc.EXTRA_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026lt;TOKENHERE\u0026gt;\u0026quot;} into the Custom JSON data, field replacing with your Token (Optional) To remove the default bloatware, select Disable system applications Enter your Company Name Click Create Assigning a profile to a device Click Devices in the left-hand pane Locate the Device using the IMEI or Serial Number Select the device by placing a tick in the selection box, then select Actions Select Configure Device, then select the relevant profile for the enrollment Click Save After you have assigned a profile to the device and it is then powered on, the end-user will be able to self-enroll the device without having to worry about pressing the screen 5 times and then scanning a QR code. This makes it a lot easier to ship a device directly to an end-user.\nConclusion There are going to be further blogs covering the Knox Service Plugin and other Samsung Knox services, however, I hope this post gives you insight into the benefits this solution can provide along with a nice guide to get you started.\n","image":"https://euc365.com/images/post/knox/knoxgettingstarted_hu94bb4decba523efdfc9de8af16144630_23808_460x200_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://euc365.com/getting-started-with-knox-mobile-enrollment/","tags":["Intune","Knox","Samsung"],"title":"Getting Started with Samsung Knox for Enterprise"},{"categories":["Azure","Microsoft Intune","Graph API","PowerBI"],"contents":"A little bit about this post At MMS 2022 I took a huge leap and briefly presented this in the Tips \u0026amp; Tricks Session. This was the first time I had ever presented in front of an audience.\nI thought it would be good to give a bit of context on how this was conceptualised and why certain aspects are the way they are (some of them still make me shudder).\nOn a day to day basis, I work for a company that provides both Professional and Managed Services. As part of our service offering, we provide reporting for technical and C-Suite stakeholders. While functional, our original report ran from the Intune Data Warehouse, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t extensible and didn\u0026rsquo;t offer much room for adding in additional metrics and visuals.\nAs a man who likes working with the Graph API, I thought, why can we not use the data directly from there??? Here began many hours of visiting dead ends and rabbit holes. Before we get going, lets talk about some of the challenges faced.\nThe first challenge was authentication. We wanted to make this work without the need for Service Accounts and Passwords etc., so we decided to use App Registrations. Unfortunately, OData feeds in PowerBI did not like using dynamically generated content within the headers for authentication when creating our dashboards. This may have changed now, but if it ain\u0026rsquo;t broke don\u0026rsquo;t fix it right?\nThe next challenge after overcoming authentication was pagination. Now, it\u0026rsquo;s tough to do without some very complex PowerBI wizardry with loops etc. So this led me to look at using Logic Apps to paginate the data for me and send it back in a response JSON.\nOne of the final challenges was publishing the report to the PowerBI service. When published, the data refresh schedule was not available. The first issue I faced was PowerBI telling me that I had an issue with Query1\u0026hellip; This query didn\u0026rsquo;t even exist. After hours of stripping the report right back, we found it to be the way we were passing in the authentication bearer token. We resolved this by nesting (Yes!!! Nesting, I told you things made me shudder.) the Authentication function within each query. After we fixed this and re-published the report, we were hopeful, but that hope lasted no more than a minute. PowerBI then suggested the data was not directly, again back into the Transform Data screen to see what we could do\u0026hellip; The final solution to this??? (Shudders at the ready!!) Nest our other two functions into the queries too.\nMoving swiftly on, let\u0026rsquo;s look at some of this in action. During this post, we will create a basic report with PowerBI. We will pull in two tables, Devices and Device Hardware information.\nWe do we need for the basics? If you would like to follow along with the post you will need the following;\nThe ability to create an Azure AD App Registration and Grant Admin Consent The ability to create an Azure Logic App PowerBI Desktop Let\u0026rsquo;s get started During this post, we will be looking at the web call to gather the bearer token and two different methods of getting data from the Graph API, and how we use them side by side to ensure we are not burning money on a consumption Logic Apps.\nAuthentication Lets start by creating an App Registration with the following Application permissions.\nDeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All If you are not familiar with creating App Registrations, take a look at my Create an Azure App Registration post.\nOnce you have added permissions and granted consent, you need to obtain a secret, this can be done from the App Registration by;\nClicking Certificates \u0026amp; Secrets Click New client secret Enter a description and select the validity period of the secret, then click Add Click the Copy icon next to the Value contents The last step is important, as once you navigate away from this page it disappears and cannot be retrieved. You can always create another, so all is not lost.\nYou now have the start of the authentication piece, lets head over to PowerBI and enter the Power Query Editor (Transform Data) and create three Parameters.\nApplicationID: This will be the Application (client) ID of the App Registration ApplicationSecret: This will be the secret value copied previously TenantID: Your Azure Tenant ID We will halt the authentication section here for now as we need some other components to start retrieving data.\nThe Logic App You can simply deploy the logic app using the button below, or follow the manual steps detailed below.\nLogic App Blade Click Add Select your Subscription and Resource Group Give you Logic App a meaningful name (e.g. EUC-MSGRAPHCALL-v1) For Publish Select Workflow and select your desired Region Select your desired plan, for this post I will be using Consumption (Optional) Select Zone Redundancy (Optional) Add Tags Click Review + Create, then click Create Once the deployment is complete click Go to resource Select a trigger, template or click Blank Logic App From the ribbon, click the Code view button Copy and paste the JSON from the Logic App Code drop down below Click Save Logic App Code { \u0026#34;definition\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://schema.management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Logic/schemas/2016-06-01/workflowdefinition.json#\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;actions\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Append_to_array_variable_-_GraphReturn\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;inputs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;GraphReturn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;@body(\u0026#39;HTTP_-_Initial_Request\u0026#39;)\u0026#34;

The value of this parameter can be found on the HTTP trigger from within the logic app as shown below.\nCreating the first query Lets head back in to the Power Query Editor (Transform Data) and start building up our first query.\nFrom the ribbon select New Source \u0026gt; Blank Query Right-click on your new query, select Rename and enter Devices Right-click on the Devices query, select Advanced Editor Paste the following content into the editor, then click Done PowerBI Query // All functions and the SessionToken Query must be within EACH query as when publishing to PowerBI Online you will receive and unable to access data source. let // ************************************* SessionToken ************************************* SessionToken = let TokenUri = \u0026#34;https://login.microsoftonline.com/\u0026#34;, ResourceId = \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com\u0026#34;, TokenResponse = Json.Document(Web.Contents(TokenUri, [ Content = Text.ToBinary(Uri.BuildQueryString([client_id = #\u0026#34;ApplicationID\u0026#34;, resource = ResourceId, grant_type = \u0026#34;client_credentials\u0026#34;, client_secret = #\u0026#34;ApplicationSecret\u0026#34;])), Headers = [Accept = \u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34;], ManualStatusHandling = {400}, RelativePath = #\u0026#34;TenantID\u0026#34; \u0026amp; \u0026#34;/oauth2/token\u0026#34; ] )), AzureAccessToken = TokenResponse[access_token] in AzureAccessToken, // ************************************* SessionToken ************************************* // ************************************* LogicAppCall ************************************* MSGraphLA = let Source = (#\u0026#34;GraphURL\u0026#34; as any) =\u0026gt; let Url = LogicAppURL, body = \u0026#34;{\u0026#34;\u0026#34;accesstoken\u0026#34;\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026amp; SessionToken \u0026amp; \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;URL\u0026#34;\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026amp; #\u0026#34;GraphURL\u0026#34; \u0026amp; \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;}\u0026#34;, Source = Json.Document(Web.Contents(Url, [Headers=[#\u0026#34;Content-Type\u0026#34;=\u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34;],Content = Text.ToBinary(body)])) in Source in Source, // ************************************* LogicAppCall ************************************* // ************************************* MS Graph Call ************************************* GraphCall = let Source = (#\u0026#34;GraphURL\u0026#34; as any) =\u0026gt; let Source = Json.Document( Web.Contents( \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/\u0026#34;, [ RelativePath = #\u0026#34;GraphURL\u0026#34;, Headers= [ Authorization= \u0026#34;Bearer \u0026#34; \u0026amp; #\u0026#34;SessionToken\u0026#34;,Accept=\u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34; ] ] ) ) in Source in Source, // ************************************* MS Graph Call ************************************* Source = #\u0026#34;MSGraphLA\u0026#34;(\u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/managedDevices\u0026#34;) in Source A yellow banner will appear stating Information is required about data privacy, click Continue Select Ignore Privacy (as per below screenshot), Alternatively, change the data sources to private, then click Save Let\u0026rsquo;s break the query down to gain further understanding of it. First lets look at the SessionToken nested function, this is where the bearer token is obtained by using the provided ApplicationID and ApplicationSecret values. The function builds up a web call with additional headers and requests the response as a JSON, from this point we then extract the returned access_token.\nThe second of three nested functions is the MSGraphLA, this is the function used to send information to the Logic App that you created. The way it handles the data is pretty simple, again this function uses a web call to post a JSON object to the Logic App. The JSON is made up of the SessionToken which slots into the accesstoken JSON value, and the GraphURL which is the value that is put into the function.\nTHe final nested function is GraphCall, this function is to be used on an ad-hoc basis. For example, I use this function when I collect the Hardware Information for a device, and the reason I do that is because when you query the device endpoint like we have done here, you do not get all of the values from the Hardware Information field. This function is basically the direct call to the Graph API, without pagination.\nOk, so that\u0026rsquo;s a start, you are now at a point were you have data within you PowerBI Report, Now you can feel free to continue the drill down of data yourself, however for anyone who wants that old Art Attack moment of \u0026lsquo;Here\u0026rsquo;s one I made earlier\u0026rsquo; you can use the below query.\nNOTE: There is still unexpanded columns with the query below, please expand them if required.\nPowerBI Query (Drilled Down) // All funtions and the SessionToken Query must be within EACH qury

in #\u0026#34;Expanded Column1\u0026#34; Using the Ad-hoc GraphCall Function In the previous part of this post, you created the first query which used the Logic App to gather all of its data. This section will explain how to use this side by side with an ad-hoc function to gather additional data from the Graph API.\nFor this example we will focus on gathering the Hardware Information of the devices. As mentioned above, calling the API Endpoint for the devices does not provide all of the information within the Hardware Information object, so to get the most of the dataset available we need to call device endpoint with the device id to expand the hardware information. Lets jump in and get going.\nFrom the ribbon select New Source \u0026gt; Blank Query Right-click on your new query, select Rename and enter Device Hardware Information Right-click on the Device Hardware Information query, select Advanced Editor Paste the following content into the editor, then click Done PowerBI Query (Device IDs) // All functions and the SessionToken Query must be within EACH query as when publishing to PowerBI Online you will receive and unable to access data source. let // ************************************* SessionToken ************************************* SessionToken = let TokenUri = \u0026#34;https://login.microsoftonline.com/\u0026#34;, ResourceId = \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com\u0026#34;, TokenResponse = Json.Document(Web.Contents(TokenUri, [ Content = Text.ToBinary(Uri.BuildQueryString([client_id = #\u0026#34;ApplicationID\u0026#34;, resource = ResourceId, grant_type = \u0026#34;client_credentials\u0026#34;, client_secret = #\u0026#34;ApplicationSecret\u0026#34;])), Headers = [Accept = \u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34;], ManualStatusHandling = {400}, RelativePath = #\u0026#34;TenantID\u0026#34; \u0026amp; \u0026#34;/oauth2/token\u0026#34; ] )), AzureAccessToken = TokenResponse[access_token] in AzureAccessToken, // ************************************* SessionToken ************************************* // ************************************* LogicAppCall ************************************* MSGraphLA = let Source = (#\u0026#34;GraphURL\u0026#34; as any) =\u0026gt; let Url = LogicAppURL, body = \u0026#34;{\u0026#34;\u0026#34;accesstoken\u0026#34;\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026amp; SessionToken \u0026amp; \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;URL\u0026#34;\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026amp; #\u0026#34;GraphURL\u0026#34; \u0026amp; \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;}\u0026#34;, Source = Json.Document(Web.Contents(Url, [Headers=[#\u0026#34;Content-Type\u0026#34;=\u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34;],Content = Text.ToBinary(body)])) in Source in Source, // ************************************* LogicAppCall ************************************* // ************************************* MS Graph Call ************************************* GraphCall = let Source = (#\u0026#34;GraphURL\u0026#34; as any) =\u0026gt; let Source = Json.Document( Web.Contents( \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/\u0026#34;, [ RelativePath = #\u0026#34;GraphURL\u0026#34;, Headers= [ Authorization= \u0026#34;Bearer \u0026#34; \u0026amp; #\u0026#34;SessionToken\u0026#34;,Accept=\u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34; ] ] ) ) in Source in Source, // ************************************* MS Graph Call ************************************* Source = #\u0026#34;MSGraphLA\u0026#34;(\u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/managedDevices?$select=id\u0026#34;), // ************************************* MS Graph Call ************************************* Source1 = Source{0}, #\u0026#34;Converted to Table\u0026#34; = Record.ToTable(Source1), Value = #\u0026#34;Converted to Table\u0026#34;{2}[Value], #\u0026#34;Converted to Table1\u0026#34; = Table.FromList(Value, Splitter.SplitByNothing(), null, null, ExtraValues.Error), ShowIDs = Table.ExpandRecordColumn(#\u0026#34;Converted to Table1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Column1\u0026#34;, {\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;}, {\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;}) in ShowIDs Notice you now have all of your device ids, from the ribbon click Add Column Click Custom Column, enter CallURL as the column name Enter each \u0026quot;deviceManagement/managedDevices/\u0026quot; \u0026amp; [id] \u0026amp; \u0026quot;?$select=hardwareInformation\u0026quot;, then click OK Create another Custom Column, enter Graph Web Call as the name Enter each #\u0026quot;GraphCall\u0026quot;([CallURL]), then click OK You will be prompted to Enter Credentials, click on the button, ensure Anonymous is selected, then click Connect (This may fail the first time, if it does cancel the prompt and then click Edit Credentials again) You will now see an additional column per device, click on the icon next to Graph Web Call in the column header Un-tick all options but hardwareInformation (I would also un-tick Use original column name as prefix), then click OK (Optional) Right-click the CallURL column, then select Remove Click on the icon next to hardwareInformation in the column header, un-tick Use original column name as prefix, then click Load More, then click OK Voilà!, you now have the hardware information for each device. There are still further columns you can expand should you see fit, but the data is now usable to create some lovely visuals. You can compare the hardwareInformation from this table to the one in the devices table and you will see the comparable difference in the datasets.\nLinking the datasets The final piece of the puzzle is to link the tables together do you can create free flowing reports and visuals. You may find that this has been done Automagically for you, however it is better to cover it just in the edge case that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t already done so, hit the save button and save your progress. Once saved minimise or close the Transform data window as it is not required.\nFrom the main PowerBI Screen click the Model button in the left-hand pane Find id in the Devices table, drag this to the id field within the Device Hardware Information table Conclusion You now have the tools to gather all of your data into PowerBI, one thing to note is that depending on amount of objects you are querying your refresh time may be extended. Using the method where you collect devices ids and then call on each object to gather data also extends the refresh time. However, if you are running this on a refresh cycle that may not be such an issue, but it is worth noting.\nThere may be better ways to do this, but this is only the first iteration of a working model, there may very well be more to come in the future.\nIf you manage multiple environments, you will only need the one Logic App. The ApplicationID, ApplicationSecret and TenantID are the only changes that would need to be made.\nIf you like the post, be sure to leave feedback below.\n","image":"https://euc365.com/images/post/graphbi/logo_hue10b3e762eaa52b2b3eb36e6a0738f46_56001_460x200_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://euc365.com/microsoft-graph-and-powerbi/","tags":["Azure","Azure AD","App Registrations","Powershell","Intune","Graph API","PowerBI","Logic Apps"],"title":"Microsoft Graph API and PowerBI"},{"categories":["Apple","Azure"],"contents":"What is SCIM? Meaning: SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)\nPurpose: SCIM allows organisations to provision Managed Apple IDs immediately and to combine Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager properties (such as SIS username and grade levels for Apple School Manager and roles) over account data imported from Azure AD. When an organisation imports users with SCIM, the account information is added as read-only in Apple School Manager and Apple Business Manager until they disconnect from SCIM, in which case the accounts become manual accounts and attributes in these accounts can then be edited. Changes made to accounts in Azure AD sync to Apple School Manager and Apple Business Manager accounts every 20 to 40 minutes.\nTaken from Apple: Integrate Apple devices with Azure AD SCIM Tokens expire xxx days, each Administrator will be notified via e-mail 60 days prior to expiry.\\\nHow do I update it?

Whats the Purpose? You maybe asking yourself why should I be adding Terms of use to Autopilot Enrolment? Well there are a few use cases that spring to mind.\nThe first been accepting an It acceptable use policy, for many years users have come to collect devices from a field office and/or had the devices delivered to them by an internal tech. Well in the current day and age of Modern Management and Windows Autopilot you now have the option to ship straight from the vendor to the end user, ensuring that the user accepts the policy prior to using the device maybe an absolute must for your organisation.\nNot only can you present these terms of use, but you can also see who has accepted and or denied these from the Azure portal, cool right?\nDid I also mention that you can add multiple languages for your terms of use, No? Well it\u0026rsquo;s actually super easy to do so without creating additional policies etc.\nCreating your Terms of Use We will be making use of conditional access and the inbuilt terms of use from the Azure portal, meaning we are taking advantage of products you may already have licenses for.\nWithout further ado, lets get started.\nHead over to the Conditional Access Pane in the Azure portal.\nUnder the Manage section, click Terms of Use\nIn the right-hand pane, click New terms\nComplete the Name and Display Name fields Click on the box that says Upload required PDF, Locate and upload the PDF of your Terms.\nSelect your default language\nAt this point you can upload the same terms in a different language, simply click **+ Add language**, Upload the PDF and then select its language from the drop down to the right-hand side.\nRequire user to expand the terms of use, now this is optional, you can choose to require the users to expand the terms of use or not. Personally, I prefer too as if the terms are broken you can show that they would have had to read them. Require users to consent on every device, This one HAS to be set to Off This has to be Off because, if you do switch it on the device has to be Joined to Azure AD Already and in fully working order. You will see this warning if you do attempt to switch it on.\nExpire Consents, again this one is optional, if you would like the user to accept it once in then never have to see it again then you can leave this off. However, If you would like users to have to accept this on another Autopilot build after a specified period of time then flick the switch on. Expire Starting On, use the date picker and select the date you are on. Frequency, Set this to your desired frequency. I like to set this to Monthly. Duration before re-acceptance required (days), set this to the amount of days you would like before the end user has to perform re-acceptance. Your final terms of use setting should look something like this; Conditional Access, you can choose to create a policy later, or select Custom Policy which will allow you to create the policy now.\nClick Create\nIf you chose to create a Custom Policy you will be redirected to a Conditional Access policy configuration. Give your Policy a name e.g. Autopilot Enrolment Terms of Use Policy Assignments, To start with I would test this out with a bunch of your techs, or users who give good feedback to ensure that this suits your organizational needs. Make sure this is targeted to users. Cloud apps and actions, now this is where we specify it to only apply to Intune Enrolment (Autopilot). Under the Cloud Apps Slider, select Select Apps, Click on the selections Type Microsoft Intune Enrollment and click the app to select it, Click Select. Conditions, You can change this to suit your needs, I generally select the Device Platform as Windows\nAccess Control - Grant, Select Grant Access, and then select your Terms of Use policy like below\nClick Select Session, You don\u0026rsquo;t need to select a Session At the bottom of the browser window, ensure that you have set Enable Policy to On. Click Create Well that\u0026rsquo;s a wrap from a configuration perspective, lets jump into some testing and see what the end user will experience.\nSo what does it look like? Firstly, you will hit the standard Autopilot Screen where you log in with your details and MFA etc. You will then notice that you are re-directed to a screen that represents the below;\nIf you selected to force the users to expand the terms, but just click accept you will see the message below pop up. If you expand the terms you will see your terms in an embedded PDF viewer, once you have finished click Accept, you will then just continue along your way on a standard Autopilot build.\nIf you have this conditional access policy enabled and a user does not accept the policy, they will be prevented from performing an Intune Enrolment. They are however able to Accept the policy on further attempts.\nHow do I see who\u0026rsquo;c Accepted/Declined? This is super easy to check, Head back over to the Conditional Access Pane in the Azure portal. From here click Terms of Use, Straight away you can see the numbers for Accepted and Declined.\nIf you go ahead and click those numbers, you can see who has/hasn\u0026rsquo;t accepted the policy, you can also download the list should it be required.\nConclusion For something so simple, it is quite effective an there may be a ton of use cases for this in other scenarios, however, I was asked to scope this out for a customer I was working with.\nI hope it may be some use :D, enjoy your day guys and girls!!!.\n","image":"https://euc365.com/images/post/apterms/FeaturedImage_hub577f64f88aa630e6b5a874de9878d48_16119_460x200_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://euc365.com/autopilot-enrolment-terms-of-use/","tags":["Azure","Azure AD","Conditional Access","Autopilot","Intune","Terms of Use"],"title":"Autopilot Enrolment Terms of Use"},{"categories":["PowerShell","Microsoft Intune","MEMCM"],"contents":"Dynamic? In what way? When I say the packages are dynamic, I mean that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to update the application package when a new version is released by the vendor.\nThere are caveats to both methods that we walk through below, there are also other community and paid for tools to do similar things.\nHowever, the reason I wrote this post and started focusing on packaging applications in this was to avoid having support tickets when a new version is released, I also wanted to use this with ConfigMGR and Intune without the requirement of additional modules.\nShow me the way! Well lets show you a couple ways to do this, Web (HTML) Scraping and using the GitHub API.\nWeb Scraping In my opinion, this is the most flawed method, as this replies on the website layout and/or table structure to stay the same as when you write your script. However, it is still an option and it works really well.\nTo be able to get the data from the tables in PowerShell we are going to need to use Invoke-WebRequest, Normally this would be super easy to use as it parses the HTML data for you. However, as this script will run as system in Intune you will need to launch it with -UseBasicParsing which complicates things a little more.\nFor this example we will use the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client, Are you ready? Lets begin. (You can achieve this using API Calls, However, this is a good example of table structure for Web Scraping)\nDetection Lets start by looking at the way we obtain the latest version and check it again the version in the registry.\nAs you can see from the image below, there is a version table right at the top of the web page.\nIf you press F12 and open the developer options, you can click through the HTML sections in the Elements tab and find the table like below;\nAs you can see from the snippet below we have to use a HTMLContent COM object to parse the HTML data so we can interact with the tables.\nIn it\u0026rsquo;s simplest form we get the RawContent and then write it to the IHTMLDocument2 object with the COM object, giving us the functionality work with the tables.\nfunction Get-LatestVersion { [String]$URL = \u0026#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/windowsdesktop-whatsnew\u0026#34; $WebResult = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $URL -UseBasicParsing $WebResultHTML = $WebResult.RawContent $HTML = New-Object -Com \u0026#34;HTMLFile\u0026#34; $HTML.IHTMLDocument2_write($WebResultHTML) $Tables = @($html.all.tags(\u0026#39;table\u0026#39;)) $LatestVer = $null [System.Collections.ArrayList]$LatestVer = New-Object -TypeName psobject for ($i = 0; $i -le $tables.count; $i++) { $table = $tables[0] $titles = @() $rows = @($table.Rows) ## Go through all of the rows in the table foreach ($row in $rows) { $cells = @($row.Cells) ## If we\u0026#39;ve found a table header, remember its titles if ($cells[0].tagName -eq \u0026#34;TH\u0026#34;) { $titles = @($cells | ForEach-Object { (\u0026#34;\u0026#34; + $_.InnerText).Trim() }) continue } $resultObject = [Ordered] @{} $counter = 0 foreach ($cell in $cells) { $title = $titles[$counter] if (-not $title) { continue } $resultObject[$title] = (\u0026#34;\u0026#34; + $cell.InnerText).Trim() $Counter++ } #$Version_Data = @() $Version_Data = [PSCustomObject]@{ \u0026#39;LatestVersion\u0026#39; = $resultObject.\u0026#39;Latest version\u0026#39; } $LatestVer.Add($Version_Data) | Out-null } } $LatestVer } Let\u0026rsquo;s take a closer look at the interaction with the tables, as you can see the variable $Tables uses the the $HTML variable which contains the COM object data to select everything with the tag of table ($Tables = @($html.all.tags('table'))). From this point it uses a for loop to gather the table data, until finally we decide which part of the table we want to use.\nFor example, We are focusing on the latest version, so if you run the for loop manually and look at $resultObject in PowerShell it will return something like this;\nFrom this point you can create a PSCustomObject with the table header you want. Now this is kind of over complicating it for this example as you could just return $resultObject.'Latest version' however, I use this loop for other methods and keeping it in this format helps me standardise the way I work, but it also gives you the ability to use if for other things too.\nAll of this is wrapped inside a function (Get-LatestVersion) as I plan on using the same script for the detection method as for the install, but I also like to re-check in my install script that the application definitely is not installed before the install action executes. If you look at the Detect-Application function you can see that I check both the 64-bit and 32-bit registry locations with an IF statement based on the variables below;\n$UninstallKey = \u0026#34;HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\\u0026#34; $UninstallKeyWow6432Node = \u0026#34;HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\\u0026#34; $LatestVersion = ((Get-LatestVersion | Get-Unique | Sort-Object $_.LatestVersion)[0]).LatestVersion $AppName = \u0026#34;Remote Desktop\u0026#34; function Detect-Application { IF (((Get-ChildItem -Path $UninstallKey | Get-ItemProperty | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like \u0026#34;*$AppName*\u0026#34;}).DisplayVersion -Match $LatestVersion) -or ((Get-ChildItem -Path $UninstallKeyWow6432Node | Get-ItemProperty | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like \u0026#34;*$AppName*\u0026#34;}).DisplayVersion -Match $LatestVersion)) { $True } } The IF statement uses an -or operator, meaning if one of the conditions matches then run the code within the brackets below. As you can see from the variables the $LatestVersion uses the Get-LatestVersion function which is used to match the display version in the registry.\nThis the fundamental foundation of the operation, as we can now detect the application without using any additional modules in the next section we will look at the download and installation of the app.\nDownload Link Now we know that we can Detect the application, lets look at obtaining the download link.\nIf you look at the below snippet, you can see we use a variable which calls a function to get the download link ($DownloadLink = Get-DownloadLink). For this to work there is a reliance on the the Variable $Arch been set, by default this is set to 64-bit. However, this is available as a command line parameter.\nparam ( [ValidateSet(\u0026#39;64-bit\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;32-bit\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;ARM64\u0026#39;)] [String]$Arch = \u0026#39;64-bit\u0026#39;, [ValidateSet(\u0026#39;Install\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Uninstall\u0026#39;,\u0026#34;Detect\u0026#34;)] [string]$ExecutionType, [string]$DownloadPath = \u0026#34;$env:Temp\\RDInstaller\\\u0026#34; ) $DownloadLink = Get-DownloadLink Lets take a look at the Get-DownloadLink function, the basics of getting the data and writing it to an HTML COM object is the same as the detection method, however this time we do not need to look at a table, we are specifically looking for a link which matched the $Arch variable.\nfunction Get-DownloadLink { $URL = \u0026#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/windowsdesktop\u0026#34; $WebResult = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $URL -UseBasicParsing $WebResultHTML = $WebResult.RawContent $HTML = New-Object -Com \u0026#34;HTMLFile\u0026#34; $HTML.IHTMLDocument2_write($WebResultHTML) ($HTML.links | Where-Object {$_.InnerHTMl -Like \u0026#34;*$Arch*\u0026#34;}).href } If you look at the web page for the downloads you will see that the links are in an unordered list;\nAgain if you hit F12 and look at the html content behind the table, you will see the data we are looking for.\nTo get this using the script we simply run ($HTML.links | Where-Object {$_.InnerHTMl -Like \u0026quot;*$Arch*\u0026quot;}).href simple right?\nDownload \u0026amp; Install Before we look at the install function, lets look at the logic that calls the install.\nLets just assume you called the script with the Install execution type (.\\\u0026lt;ScriptName.ps1 -ExecutionType Install) or launched it without any parameters.\nLets look inside the default section highlighted below, firstly it will check if the latest version of the application is not installed using an IF statement, ELSE return that it is already installed.\nIf the application is not installed it then proceeds to attempt the installation in a try{} catch{} statement. The basics of this is as it says, it will try the install, if it fails it will catch it and throw back the Write-Error text.\nswitch ($ExecutionType) { Detect { Detect-Application } Uninstall { try { Uninstall-Application -ErrorAction Stop \u0026#34;Uninstallation Complete\u0026#34; } catch { Write-Error \u0026#34;Failed to Install $AppName\u0026#34; } } Default { IF (!(Detect-Application)) { try { \u0026#34;The latest version is not installed, Attempting install\u0026#34; Install-Application -ErrorAction Stop \u0026#34;Installation Complete\u0026#34; } catch { Write-Error \u0026#34;Failed to Install $AppName\u0026#34; } } ELSE { \u0026#34;The Latest Version ($LatestVersion) of $AppName is already installed\u0026#34; } } } Lets take a look at the Install-Application function that is called in the statement.\nLets Break it down into stages.\nChecks if the $DownloadPath exists, if not it will try to create it.

This is because the MSI Key name is the GUID, it will then build up the MSIEXEC arguments for the uninstall. After it has completed both steps it will then process with the uninstallation.\nFinished Script If you compile all of the sections together with a little bit of formatting you will end up with a script like the one below.\nExamples To Install the 64-Bit version .\\Dynamic-RemoteDesktopClient.ps1\nTo Install the 32-Bit version .\\Dynamic-RemoteDesktopClient.ps1 -Arch '32-bit'\nTo detect the installation only .\\Dynamic-RemoteDesktopClient.ps1 -ExecutionType Detect\nTo uninstall the application .\\Dynamic-RemoteDesktopClient.ps1 -ExecutionType Uninstall\nYou will need to change the param block variable for $ExecutionType to $ExecutionType = Detect when using this as a detection method within Intune or ConfigMGR.\n\u0026lt;# .SYNOPSIS This is a script to Dynamically Detect, Install and Uninstall the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client for Windows. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/windowsdesktop .DESCRIPTION Use this script to detect, install or uninstall the Microsoft Remote Desktop client for Windows .PARAMETER Arch Select the architecture you would like to install, select from the following - 64-bit (Default) - 32-bit - ARM64 .PARAMETER ExecutionType Select the Execution type, this determines if you will be detecting, installing uninstalling the application.

Some vendors host their content on GitHub as this provides build pipelines, wikis, projects and a whole host of other things. This is the method that is least likely to change, and if it does it will be documented using the GitHub API Docs.\nFor this example we are going to look at using Git for Windows, we will be using their GitHub Repo to query the version and also get the download.\nGitHub has a rate limit for the API calls, unautenticated calls has a rate limit of 60, GitHub authenticated accounts has a limit of 5000 and GitHub Enterprise accounts has a limit of 15000 calls. Each time the script is launched it used1 call, so in terms of a detection and installation you will need a 2 api calls. You will need to take this into account if you plan to package multiple applications in this way, you could use multiple accounts and randomise the PAC Key from an array, however this is something that should be highlighted.\nGIT Detection Lets start by looking at the latest releases page.\nThe first thing you may notice that it automatically redirects the URL, but we just want to check the version.\nNow that we know what the latest version is on the GitHub page, lets take a look at the API. If you change the URL in your browser to https://api.github.com/repos/git-for-windows/git/releases/latest, you will see a JSON response like the below.\n{ \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/repos/git-for-windows/git/releases/37800609\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;assets_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/repos/git-for-windows/git/releases/37800609/assets\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;upload_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://uploads.github.com/repos/git-for-windows/git/releases/37800609/assets{?name,label}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;html_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.30.1.windows.1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: 37800609, \u0026#34;author\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;login\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;git-for-windows-ci\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: 24522801, \u0026#34;node_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTIyODAx\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;avatar_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24522801?v=4\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;gravatar_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/users/git-for-windows-ci\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;html_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://github.com/git-for-windows-ci\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;followers_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/users/git-for-windows-ci/followers\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;following_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/users/git-for-windows-ci/following{/other_user}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;gists_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/users/git-for-windows-ci/gists{/gist_id}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;starred_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/users/git-for-windows-ci/starred{/owner}{/repo}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;subscriptions_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/users/git-for-windows-ci/subscriptions\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;organizations_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/users/git-for-windows-ci/orgs\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;repos_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/users/git-for-windows-ci/repos\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;events_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/users/git-for-windows-ci/events{/privacy}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;received_events_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/users/git-for-windows-ci/received_events\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;User\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;site_admin\u0026#34;: false }, \u0026#34;node_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MDc6UmVsZWFzZTM3ODAwNjA5\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tag_name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;v2.30.1.windows.1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;target_commitish\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;main\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Git for Windows 2.30.1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;draft\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;prerelease\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;created_at\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2021-02-09T12:53:04Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;published_at\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2021-02-09T13:41:03Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;assets\u0026#34;: [ All objects in assets, this is just a snippet] } If you look at the highlighted line above, you will notice that the versions matches the one on the latest release page.\nNow we know what property within the API we are looking for and how it displays, we can head into PowerShell and start working on the detection.\nFirst of all we need to get the latest version, to do this we first perform and API Call to get all of the information and store the information in the $RestResult variable.\nTake a look at the below snippet;\nparam ( [ValidateSet(\u0026#39;64-bit\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;32-bit\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;ARM64\u0026#39;)] [String]$Arch = \u0026#39;64-bit\u0026#39;, [ValidateSet(\u0026#39;Install\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Uninstall\u0026#39;,\u0026#34;Detect\u0026#34;)] [string]$ExecutionType = \u0026#34;Detect\u0026#34;, [string]$DownloadPath = \u0026#34;$env:Temp\\GitInstaller\\\u0026#34;, [string]$GITPAC ) ############################################################################## ##################### Get the Information from the API ####################### ############################################################################## [String]$GitHubURI = \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/repos/git-for-windows/git/releases/latest\u0026#34;

Once it has the data we want to then format the $LatestVersion variable to return just the version number, for this we use the .split() operator, by default this splits on spaces, you can specify other characters to split it with by adding in something like '.' and it would split the string at every point there is a dot.

Can you run a full Linux setup in this way? Well the answer to that is NO unfortunately not. This tool is designed for developers and other users who use bash and other common Linux tools.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t go on as all of the information about WSL is in the link on the Microsoft Documentation text above.\nI will however provide the two scripts I use and wrote (nothing special just a couple of lines) for deployment and detection and demonstrate how to deploy with MEMCM.\nOnce the subsystem is installed it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that a Linux distribution is automatically installed. You can access these distributions via the Public Microsoft Store, however if you use this in an Enterprise and would like them added to your Enterprise Store you will need to contact your Store Admin.

Please see the Private store availability section below\nIf you want to deploy the application to just a specific user(s), you can just add them individually.\nClick Assign to Users Enter their Name or Email Address Select the User Click Assign Wait for the process to complete, click Close Private store availability I would suggest using Specific Groups for the distros, As this have a requirement of WSL been enabled, unless you deploy this as a required deployment.\nNo one Make sure you remove it from any Users in the users tab if you want to ensure No One has access to it.\nIf you want to stop deploying the application, you simply have to select No one. No options for confirmation, it just removes ot from the Microsoft Store.\nEveryone If you want to deploy the application to your whole organisation, you simply have to select Everyone. No options for confirmation, it just makes this available in the Microsoft Store. Specific Groups If you want to deploy the application to a group of Users select Specific Groups.\nClick Assign Groups Enter the Name of the group Select the Group Click Add Groups Offline This option allows you to download the AppX Package for installation with DISM, PowerShell CmdLets or your MDM Provider.\nClick Manage Select your Platform, Minimum Version, Architecture, App Metadata You will then see something like the image below, this contains the Package Identity Name, Package family name, Package full name, Package format and the Supported architectures. Click Download I will demonstrate how to install this using PowerShell, however, please see the Distribute Offline Apps Microsoft Documentation for alternative methods.\nLaunch a Admin PowerShell console Browse to the directory the AppXBundle is stored Type Add-AppxPackage -Path .\\\u0026lt;PackageName\u0026gt;.AppxBundle, Hit Enter The distro is now installed You can check that the distro is installed by using the Package Identity Name.\nGet-AppxPackage -Name \u0026lt;Package Identity Name\nDistribute the content using your preferred method The Distro will now appear in your Start Menu To Enable WSL for use the device must be restarted, If you see the below message, WSL is either not installed or your device is pending a reboot.\nSummary I hope that you find this useful if you ever need to deploy WSL. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out using the Contact page or in the comment section below.\nI had to use WSL the other day when deploying Docker Desktop as a dependency, the script came in handy for sure.\n","image":"https://euc365.com/images/post/deploywsl/FeaturedImage_hu88af6168fb2889d0285544f033f3f748_59352_460x200_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://euc365.com/deploy-windows-subsystem-for-linux/","tags":["Powershell","Intune","MEMCM","Application Deployment"],"title":"Deploy Windows Subsystem for Linux"},{"categories":["PowerShell","Microsoft Intune"],"contents":"Win32 Apps, What Are they? If you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with Configuration Manager/MEMCM then think of these files as your source directory, the difference being you are effectively zipping it up and then uploading to Intune.\nAccording to Microsoft, if you decide to use Win32 Apps, it is advised that you use these exclusively and NOT \u0026lsquo;Mix and Match\u0026rsquo; these with Line of Business applications when using Autopilot (See Microsoft Doc link below).\nWhat content can be in a Win32 App Package? The answer to that is well pretty much anything to a certain extent. These files are just proprietary files for Intune however under the hood they are just zip files that are then hashed and encoded.\nWhat uses are there for Win32 Apps? Well put, to Install apps. Now don\u0026rsquo;t be thrown by the 32 as these are not just for 32-bit apps, they can be used for any app.\nYou can use Win32 apps to just launch PowerShell scripts, Batch scripts, VBScripts etc. as long as you have a detection method if they succeed.\nMainly they are used for installing custom app packages like Greenshot, Citrix, PSADT Apps etc.\nMicrosoft Doc: Win32 app management in Microsoft Intune | Microsoft Docs\nPackage Creation Methods IntuneWinAppUtil Application The first method is creating a packaged using the GUI (Well kind of GUI) that is mentioned in the Microsoft Doc. Yiu can grab the utility from the below link;\nGitHub - Microsoft/Microsoft-Win32-Content-Prep-Tool: A tool to wrap Win32 App and then it can be uploaded to Intune\nIf you clone/download the files, and extract them to a suitable location to work with.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get started. The below works on the assumption you have your files in a folder with noting other than those required for the app. (You don\u0026rsquo;t want to be uploading your entire desktop do you :P)\nLaunch the IntuneWinAppUtil.exe Type/Paste your Source Directory (e.g. C:/Win 32 Apps/7-Zip), hit Enter. Type/Paste you setup file name (e.g. 7z2002-x64.exe or MyScript.ps1), hit Enter Type/Paste your Output Directory (e.g. C:/Win 32 Apps), hit Enter. When prompted about catalogue files type N unless you are deploying to Windows S Mode, hit Enter The window will automatically close when your .intunewin file is finished if you head over your output folder you will be able to get your file for upload. PowerShell PowerShell Gallery | IntuneWin32App 1.2.0\nFor you command-line gurus and script lovers out there, you will be pleased to know that there is a PowerShell module for bundling these your apps up, you can even go a step further and import them via a script, but we will save that for another post :D.\nYou can install the module using the following command;\n# # To install the module for the current user add -Scope CurrentUser to the below command # Install-Module IntuneWin32App Once you have the module installed you can type a command like this;\n# # Setup File example: Powershell.ps1, setup.exe, MyInstaller.msi # New-IntuneWin32AppPackage -SourceFolder \u0026#34;C:\\Win32 Apps\\7-Zip\u0026#34; -OutputFolder \u0026#34;C:\\Win32 Apps\\Outputs\u0026#34; -SetupFile 7z2002-x64.exe This command will create a .intunewin file in the output location named 7z2002-x64.intunewin, this is because it takes the installers name for the output. Unfortunately at the time of writing this, you can\u0026rsquo;t do it natively with this module. However, you can add a Rename-Item into your script to change it.\nUsing the packages with Intune Head over to Microsoft Intune admin center (Intune) to to get started\nSelect Apps from the navigation pane Select All Apps, Click Add Select App type Other\u0026gt;Windows app (Win32), Click Select Click Select app package file, Click the Blue Folder icon to open the browse windows Select the .intunewin file you have created, Click Open and then click OK Fill out the Name and Publisher mandatory fields, and any other fields you desire Upload an icon if you desire, I would recommend doing this if you are deploying this to users via the Company Portal Click Next Enter your install command (e.g. 7z2002-x64.exe /S) Enter your uninstall command (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\7-Zip\\Uninstall.exe\" /S) Select your install behavior, if this is a machine wide installation you will need to select System, otherwise select User if this is installing to the user profile Select your desired restart behavior, Adding custom return codes if required Click Next Complete your OS Requirements, At a minimum you need to specify the Architecture (x86/x64) and the minimum OS Version (e.g. 1607/1703 etc.) Click Next For Detection rules, See the Detection Rules section below, Once complete click Next Add any dependent Intune Apps you may require, Click Next Assign the application to your desired group, just as a NOTE if you want to display the app in the company portal, it MUST be assigned to a group containing that user. Required Assignments will force the app to install, whereas Available will show this in the Company Portal. Click Next Click Create That is your app finished and deploying, it is worth noting it may take 15/20 minutes to be available on the device, the device must also perform a sync to check for the app. Detection Rules\nDetection rules have 4 options, you can use a Custom Detection Script, Registry, File(Folder) and MSI, lets look at them in a little bit more detail.\nWhen you first reach the Detection Rule Screen you will have a single Drop-Down box with two options, Use a custom detection script and Manually configure detection rules. File, Registry and MSI are all available under the Manual option, it is worth noting that you can can mix and match these rules, however there are considered AND methods. If you are looking to do a AND/OR detection you will need to use a custom PowerShell Script.\nWe will dive into all of the options below.\nFile As you can see above using this detection method is fairly straight forward, however it can get a bit messy if you use the Date Created/Modified options.\nLets put a rule together.\nRule Type - File Path - \"YourPath\" (e.g. C:\\Program Files\\7-Zip\\) File or Folder - \"YourFileFolder\" (e.g. 7z.exe) Detection Method - File or Folder Exists Associated with a 32-bit app on a 64-bit client, No. Now that rule is very quick and simple, as mentioned you can use the date modified or created option, and that would look something like below. Rule Type - File Path - \"YourPath\" (e.g. C:\\Program Files\\7-Zip\\) File or Folder - \"YourFileFolder\" (e.g. 7z.exe) Detection Method - Date Modified Operator, select the option that you wish to validate against (e.g. Equals, Greater than etc.) Select the date using the date picker and enter the time using the 12 hour format Associated with a 32-bit app on a 64-bit client, No. Registry The registry option is fairly straight forward, and is the most likely option you are going to select if you are just installing a simple application and just want to check that the program itself exists. Again for the detection method you have various options, for this example we will just use Key Exists\nRule Type - Registry Key Path - \"Path to key\" (e.g. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Uninstall/7-Zip) Value Name - \"Value Name\" (e.g. DisplayVersion) Detection Method - File or Folder Exists Associated with a 32-bit app on a 64-bit client, No. MSI MSI detections are quick and easy if you are installing an MSI application, all you need is the GUID, for the 7-zip app this is not applicable however below is a basic example. You can also perform version checks on the MSI apps.\nRule Type - MSI MSI Product Code - \"Product GUID\" (e.g. {8C3A8923-0000-0000-0000-C82C1BE7294D}) MSI product version check - Yes Select your operator (e.g. Equals, Greater than etc.) Value - Product Version (e.g. 20.02) Detection Script For me, this is the most favorable option, but I love to script :D. But that aside you can check multiple actions, the only thing you need to do is return any value other than Null for the detection to pass. For example the below script checks for the registry value and also that the file exists, if they do it will return a True value, else it will return nothing.\n# $7zReg = \u0026#34;HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\7-Zip\u0026#34; $7zExe = \u0026#34;$env:ProgramFiles\\7-zip\\7z.exe\u0026#34; IF ((Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path $7zReg -Name DisplayVersion) -and (Test-Path $7zExe)) { $true } else {} You will need to have the file save and ready to be upload to Intune, The above is written in PowerShell so will need a .ps1 extension. To use this method follow the below steps.\nRule format - Use custom detection script Script file - Upload yours using the blue folder icon Run Script as a 32-bit process on 64-bit clients - No (This is entirely your choice again but for this example it is not required) Enforce script signature check and run script silently - No That covers the basics all of the detection methods, if you have any further questions please reach out or review the Microsoft Docs. 3rd Party/Community Tools \u0026amp; Blogs Here are some of the 3rd Party and Community Tools and Blogs that I have found useful and they may help you in you hour of need!!\nSyst \u0026amp; Deploy - Intune Win32 App Tool This is a great tool to create and extract/decode Win32 apps if you prefer a GUI to creating your intunewin files, this tool also has a feature to decode the packages you already have incase you loose the source files but have the intunewin file.\nIntune Win32app tool - Create and Extract Intunewin | Syst \u0026amp; Deploy (systanddeploy.com)\nOliver Kieselbach - How to decode Win32 App Packages This is a great guide and it can truly help pull you out of the gutter if you have lost all of your intunewin files, although its not straight forward to get them back (Not Oliver\u0026rsquo;s Fault) this guid provides you an in-depth guide on how to retrieve the intunewin packages.

Welcome (Back) to another post about the graph API\u0026rsquo;s, This time it isn\u0026rsquo;t so much about rambling through documentation but about giving you a nice handy tip on your route to finding what API is been called when browsing in the Web Console.\nThe only things your are going to need for this will be an Azure AD Account with permissions to at least Read policies and a modern web browser, Yes really that\u0026rsquo;s it.\nTo test the API Paths you can use Postman or Microsoft Graph Explorer\nLets get started We are going to be using Azure AD groups for this but the same methods can be used across the board (Users, Intune etc.).\nLets start by opening your browser and browse to https://portal.azure.com, Once loaded if you hit the F12 key you will see the Developer Tools pane open. The next steps may vary based on your browser choice (I\u0026rsquo;m using Edge), If you click on the Network tab (shown below) you will notice it is blank.\nIf you navigate your way to Groups (Azure Active Directory \u0026gt; Groups) you will notice it starts to populate the left pane (As below)\nAs you can see there are some little cogs next to some of the rows, If you click on one of these you will see there will be data within them\u0026hellip; In this case I am going to use the one that is a darker grey in the above image. If you click on it in the right pane you will see what data is returned (As shown Below).\nIf you expand the value field you will see the data that it has returned and will notice that it matchs up to what your seeing on screen. Now if you hover over the field you will see what API call has been made (See Below).\nIf you right-click on the entry and click Copy\u0026gt;Copy Link Address and head over to the Graph Explorer and paste the URL into the URL box, you will receive the same results, albeit better formatted.\nTo Summarise Now this is only the start of the journey, you can use the knowledge you gain and already have to combine the two and make your own apps/scripts off of the back of it.

Why would you need to back up something that runs in stored and hosted on Azure? Well there are numerous answers to this question really.\nIf you make a change and you break something you can look back and analyse what it was You can make copies of the policy easily rather than having two windows side by side In case one is deleted… (Let’s hope this is never the case) To review the maturity of your policies (Lets say you started from ground zero and now have over 100 policy settings… Might be nice to review what you’ve done) We also live in a world of change management and service improvement so there is always a need to make changes to policies and configurations. If you have or are moving from traditional group policy you will know that you can run an HTML report or a backup before you go ahead and make any changes. Well when using Intune there was no way to export or backup your profiles or policies from the console… I have seen people taking screenshots of the pages as a backup of the policies which is far from an ideal scenario.\nWhat if I told you there is a way you can back-up your configuration policies using the Microsoft Graph API?? Well it’s possible and it’s easier than you think.\nThis is part of a series of posts about backing up and importing policies and profiles, so if you feel like you\u0026rsquo;ve read this part before then you probably have.\nBack when I wrote my first post about these (HERE) the script just backed up the policies/profiles, however over time they have grown into scripts that you can also use to re-import these policies/profile.\nThis one is the Fourth in the series, where we will focus on App Protection Policies. Each one has brought its own challenges which are hopefully mitigated within the script, but if not you can always get in touch and let me know.\nThe Script You will notice that most of this (the authentication part and most of the param block at least) are the same as my other script\u0026hellip; But if its not broke why fix it? (Those famous last words!!!). Although this script does have an alternative run method, if you run it directly without the ClientID, ClientSecret and TenantID parameters it will install the Azure AD Powershell module and use a custom Function (Connect-AzAD_Token) to enable users to interact with a login Window if they do not wish to use Azure AD App Registrations with client secrets.\nThis script can be run from anywhere, as a user (If the using the command line parameters or if the AzureAD Module is installed already), as an Administrator or even as System. You could put this into an Automation Engine to do backups on a schedule if that is your desire but this would need to be done with an Azure App Registration.\nparam( [Parameter(DontShow = $true)] [string] $MsGraphVersion = \u0026#34;beta\u0026#34;, [Parameter(DontShow = $true)] [string] $MsGraphHost = \u0026#34;graph.microsoft.com\u0026#34;, #The AzureAD ClientID (Application ID) of your registered AzureAD App [string] $ClientID, #The Client Secret for your AzureAD App [string] $ClientSecret, #Your Azure Tenent ID [string] $TenantId, [Parameter()] [string] $OutputFolder = \u0026#34;.\\AppProtectionPolicyBackup\u0026#34;, [switch] $Import, [string] $ImportJSON )# FUNCTION Connect-AzAD_Token { Write-Host -ForegroundColor Cyan \u0026#34;Checking for AzureAD module...\u0026#34;

You will finally end up with something like this; ./Backup_Import_AppProtectionPolicies.ps1 -ClientID \u0026quot;\u0026quot; -ClientSecret \u0026quot;\u0026quot; -TenantID \u0026quot;\u0026quot; -Import -ImportJSON \u0026quot;./YourServerBackups/AppProtectionPolicies/ImportMe.JSON\u0026quot;\nDirect Execution If you launch the script without the Client ID, Secret and Tenant ID you will be prompted with a Microsoft Logon Window similar to the below.\nOnce you login the script will continue to run and then output the configuration files in the same way it would using the App Registration. You will need an account with permissions to be able to read (for backups only) or Read and Write the App Protection Policies. However the likelihood is that if you are looking at this guide you are probably an Intune Service Administrator or Global Administrator on your Tenant.\nWhen you run it directly without any switches the script will prompt you to log in and it would only perform a backup of your profiles and output the configurations to the the folder you are executing it from.\nIf you add the -OutputFolder parameter you can change the destination of the base output folder. However if you are wishing to use the script to Import policies you can add the -Import and -ImportJSON parameters, If you specify the -Import parameter you must also specify the -ImportJSON parameter with a path to the JSON file (e.g. C:/ImportMe.json) otherwise the script will display a message that you did not specify the -ImportJSON Parameter.\nYou will notice that when you run the script, if the folder does not exist it will create it.

Policy.Read.All (Application Permission) Importing Conditional Access Policies For Direct Execution (Using the login box) you will need;\nPolicy.Read.All (Delegate Permission) Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess (Delegate Permission) Application.Read.All (Delegate Permission) Using the ClientID, ClientSecret and TenantID (Unattended) you will need; Policy.Read.All (Application Permission) Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess (ApplicationPermission) Application.Read.All (Application Permission) GRAPH API DOCUMENTATION If you are not executing the script directly, you will also need the Tenant ID and the account that the script will be running as will need permission to the Output folder for backups.\nIf your not sure how to create an Azure AD App Registration head over to one of my other posts by clicking HERE, Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to store your Client ID and Secret securely and also have it to hand for the rest of the post :D.\nRedirect URI For this one, there is a little bit more to do with the Azure AD Application. We are going to need to add a re-write URI for Authentication when using the Login Prompt (Delegated Permissions). If you do not have a Redirect URI or it is not the correct one you will recieve an error like below.\nWe need to add urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob as a redirect URI for the application. To do so follow the below steps;\nBrowse to your Azure AD Application Registration Click on Authntication located in the left pane Click Add a Platform Click Mobile and Desktop applications Copy and paste urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob into the Redirect URI field Click Configure This will enable the Authentication box to work with Conditional Access. Unfortunately I was unable to add these Permissions to the Microsoft Intune PowerShell Enterprise Application so I could have left this as a default ClientID for that in each tenant. Executing the Script Unattended with an Azure AD App Registration You can run this script directly from a PowerShell console, using Task Scheduler or using a 3rd party automation product that supports Powershell.\nThe main thing we will go through here is just the parameters and then putting them all together from the command line, it\u0026rsquo;s really that simple.\nFor Backup Only Client ID: This is the Client ID for your Azure AD App ClientSecret: The Client Secret for the Azure AD App TenantID: Your Azure Tenant ID OutputFolder: Your desired Output folder ./Backup_Import_ConditionalAccessPolicies.ps1 -ClientID \u0026quot;\u0026quot; -ClientSecret \u0026quot;\u0026quot; -TenantID \u0026quot;\u0026quot; -OutputFolder \u0026quot;./YourServerBackups/ConditionalAccessPolicies\u0026quot;\nFor Importing Policies Client ID: This is the Client ID for your Azure AD App ClientSecret: The Client Secret for the Azure AD App TenantID: Your Azure Tenant ID Import: This is a switch parameter which states if your intention is to import or not ImportJSON: the path to your JSON file. You will finally end up with something like this; ./Backup_Import_ConditionalAccessPolicies.ps1 -ClientID \u0026quot;\u0026quot; -ClientSecret \u0026quot;\u0026quot; -TenantID \u0026quot;\u0026quot; -Import -ImportJSON \u0026quot;./YourServerBackups/ConditionalAccessPolicies/ImportMe.JSON\u0026quot;\nDirect Execution (With your Azure AD App Registration) There is a slight change here from my previous posts as mentioned above in the Script section we need an Azure AD App registration for this one in any case. The fundamental difference here though is the permission type (Delegate) and it does not require a Secret and TenantID.\nIf you launch the script without the required -DelegateClientID parameter you will be prompted with a message saying you need to launch it with one. So for this direct execution you will need to launch the script like below;\nFor Backup ./Backup_Import_ConditionalAccessPolicies.ps1 -DelegateClientID \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\nFor Import ./Backup_Import_ConditionalAccessPolicies.ps1 -DelegateClientID \u0026quot;\u0026quot; -Import -ImportJSON \u0026quot;./YourServerBackups/ConditionalAccessPolicies/ImportMe.JSON\u0026quot;\nYou will then be prompted with a Microsoft Logon Window similar to the below.\nOnce you login the script will continue to run and then output the policy files in the same way it would using the App Registration.\nIf you add the -OutputFolder parameter you can change the destination of the base output folder. However if you are wishing to use the script to Import policies you can add the -Import and -ImportJSON parameters, If you specify the -Import parameter you must also specify the -ImportJSON parameter with a path to the JSON file (e.g. C:/ImportMe.json) otherwise the script will display a message that you did not specify the -ImportJSON Parameter.\nYou will notice that when you run the script, if the folder does not exist it will create it. It also put its into a dated folder in the yyyyMMdd_HH-mm-ss format leaving you with something like 20200914_11-52-22\nSummary This can also be useful if you are wanting to make a copy of your policies to assign to a test machine. All you will need to do is backup your current policies and amend the JSON file, If you find the displayName field in the JSON file and amend it and save the file you will be able to re-import this the same settings. All you then need to do is assign it.\nI have tested this myself at the time of writing the post but if you come across any information you think may be wrong then please leave a comment or e-mail me on david@euc365.com.\nI hope this is useful for your needs.\n","image":"https://euc365.com/images/post/backupconditionalaccess/FeaturedImage_hubd800af2b061297bd97bdf31d47a608b_49712_460x200_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://euc365.com/backup-and-import-conditional-access-policies/","tags":["Azure","App Registrations","Powershell","Intune","Graph API","Conditional Access"],"title":"Backup and Import Conditional Access Policies"},{"categories":["Powershell","Microsoft Intune","Graph API"],"contents":"Why backup Compliance Policies Why would you need to back up something that runs in stored and hosted on Azure?

Once you login the script will continue to run and then output the configuration files in the same way it would using the App Registration. You will need an account with permissions to be able to read (for backups only) or Read and Write the Compliance Policies. However the likelihood is that if you are looking at this guide you are probably an Intune Service Administrator or Global Administrator on your Tenant.\nWhen you run it directly without any switches the script will prompt you to log in and it would only perform a backup of your profiles and output the configurations to the the folder you are executing it from.\nIf you add the -OutputFolder parameter you can change the destination of the base output folder. However if you are wishing to use the script to Import policies you can add the -Import and -ImportJSON parameters, If you specify the -Import parameter you must also specify the -ImportJSON parameter with a path to the JSON file (e.g. C:/ImportMe.json) otherwise the script will display a message that you did not specify the -ImportJSON Parameter.\nYou will notice that when you run the script, if the folder does not exist it will create it.

Why would you need to back up something that runs in stored and hosted on Azure? Well there are numerous answers to this question really.\nIf you make a change and you break something you can look back and analyse what it was You can make copies of the policy easily rather than having two windows side by side In case one is deleted... (Let's hope this is never the case) To review the maturity of your policies (Lets say you started from ground zero and now have over 100 policy settings... Might be nice to review what you've done) We also live in a world of change management and service improvement so there is always a need to make changes to policies and configurations. If you have or 9are moving from traditional group policy you will know that you can run an HTML report or a backup before you go ahead and make any changes. Well when using Intune there was no way to export or backup your profiles or policies from the console\u0026hellip; I have seen people taking screenshots of the pages as a backup of the policies which is far from an ideal scenario.\nWhat if I told you there is a way you can back-up your configuration policies using the Microsoft Graph API??

If your not sure how to create an Azure AD App Registration head over to one of my other posts by clicking HERE, Don't forget to store your Client ID and Secret securely and also have it to hand for the rest of the post :D. Executing the Script There are numerous ways you can execute this script, you could use it as a script in Script in MEMCM or Intune, In a Task Sequence, as an Application or Package (You will need to add some for of check file for the detection rule) or you could execute this directly from the command line.\nI will demonstrate the Script in MEMCM and Intune for you.\nScript in MEMCM This is the best option if you want to do it manually on a case by case basis (i.e. Right click on the computer object and select run script).\nJump into the Script section in MEMCM (Software Library \u0026gt; Scripts) and click Create Script from the ribbon.\nGive the script a Name, select the language as PowerShell and then copy and paste the script above (Tip: In the top right corner of the script block you can click Copy Script Text).\nClick Next, This is where you need the details we noted earlier. MEMCM is great at pulling through the Param block parameters, all we need to do is amend the ClientID, ClientSecret and TenantId arguments as below.\nAs we are using the environment variable for the InputDevice we will need to Hide this from selection as the script will use the Environment Variable if the parameter is not used.\nDouble Click on InputDevice, Change the Hidden drop down to True click OK.\nWhen finished click Next review the settings and then click next and then close.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to Approve your Script\nNow lets choose a client computer from Assets and Compliance \u0026gt; Devices. Right click on the object and select Run Script, Select the script object you created and review the details and then let the script run.\nThis does not take long to run and the output of the script if the device is successfully added to the group is as below;\nAs mentioned before as these devices are Hybrid Joined they have two entries in Azure AD which is why the output shows its adding the device twice with two different GUIDS.\nScript in Intune This time the script needs to be saved as a .ps1 file to be uploaded and used by Intune, unfortunately using the Scripts section in Intune you cannot specify parameters so you will need to put your Client ID, Secret, TenantID and Group ID into the script before uploading. You could use a Win32 App as an alternative method if you wish to use them via the command line. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve saved the script launch the Endpoint Manager Console from your favourite web browser.\nSelect Devices from the left hand pane, under the Policy section click Scripts.\nClick Add \u0026gt; Windows 10, Name your script appropriately and enter a short description (Even a link to this blog :P), Once you\u0026rsquo;ve done hit next and then select your script to use.\nLeave all of the sliders as No;\nClick Next, Add your Scope Tags (if any) and your assignments. Review the configuration and click Add.\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t run instantaneously, please refer to the Microsoft Documentation this also has some other notable consideration listed.\nTo Conclude These are just two of the ways you can run the script, you could also potentially run this in the back end of a web application for people who want to request to disable things like Windows Hello (As I mentioned at the start). I could spent days, weeks even months on writing articles for some of the uses. A user one will no doubt follow in due course so watch this space :D.\nI did fully test these methods at the time of writing the blog but if you come across any information you think may be wrong then please leave a comment or e-mail me on David@euc365.com.\nI hope this is useful for your needs.\n","image":"https://euc365.com/images/post/addtoaadgroup/Featuredimage_hu3628e62f4b830086042ed40985c25021_8390_460x200_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://euc365.com/add-devices-to-an-azure-ad-group-using-the-microsoft-graph-api/","tags":["Azure AD","Azure","App Registrations","Graph API"],"title":"Add devices to an Azure Group using the Microsoft Graph API"},{"categories":["Powershell","Microsoft Intune","MEMCM","Graph API"],"contents":"I have been working on a project at the company I work for, and up to this point we have been primarily focused on getting new devices imported and deploying via Autopilot.\nNow we have successfully leaped over that hurdle with very little issues (apart from the odd TPM attestation issue here and there and the ESP Profile page been skipped), we moved onto focusing on our current estate and how to import these into Autopilot .\nThere is a couple of ways to do this, you could run this in a package, as an application, as a script or in a task sequence for when you decide to re-build the machines.\nNow the choice is yours on which method will suit your organization the best.\nThe Script Now on GitHub Now, lets talk about the script itself. When I started out on this path I used Michael Niehaus\u0026rsquo; Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo script, even before this had the -online parameter. I was also hoping to leverage the same script for importing devices into Autopilot silently.\nThere was however a couple of stumbling blocks for me not doing so, the first been the Connect-MSGraph would not connect using the ClientID and Secret from the Azure App Registration and kept prompting for credentials. The second being it downloaded other PowerShell Modules. This was an issue for us as firstly it added a further time delay to the script and secondly one of our security product blocked it during this process.\nI had also recently started leveraging the Microsoft Graph API and decided to find a way to do this without additional the modules while achieving the same outcome. And the following is the outcome.\nI have recently updated the script (28/08/2020) to include the use of Group Tags, but also to add the -Hash parameter. The hash parameter allows you to use any device has to register it with your tenant, for example if you had a folder with a set of .csv files containing the device hash\u0026rsquo;s you could do a recursive import of all of these.\nIf you want to export a device hash to a CSV file to test this use the following command which will create the CSV.\nYou can either copy and paste the hash or import the CSV into PowerShell and reference it that way.\nGet-CimInstance -Namespace root/cimv2/mdm/dmmap -Class MDM_DevDetail_Ext01 -Filter \u0026#34;InstanceID=\u0026#39;Ext\u0026#39; AND ParentID=\u0026#39;./DevDetail\u0026#39;\u0026#34; | Export-CSV \u0026#34;C:\\$($ENV:ComputerName)_HardwareInformation.csv\u0026#34; -NoTypeInformation \u0026lt;#PSScriptInfo .VERSION 2.0 .AUTHOR David Brook .COMPANYNAME EUC365 .COPYRIGHT .TAGS Autopilot; Intune; Mobile Device Management .LICENSEURI .PROJECTURI .ICONURI .EXTERNALMODULEDEPENDENCIES .REQUIREDSCRIPTS .EXTERNALSCRIPTDEPENDENCIES .RELEASENOTES Version 2.0: Added the ability to make the script accept command line arguments for just the Hash and also allow Group Tags Version 1.0: Original published version. #\u0026gt; \u0026lt;# .SYNOPSIS This script will import devices to Microsoft Intune Autopilot using the device\u0026#39;s hardware hash. .DESCRIPTION This script will import devices to Microsoft Intune Autopilot using the device\u0026#39;s hardware hash with the added capability of been able to add a Group Tag. .PARAMETER MSGraphVersion The Version of the MS Graph API to use Default: Beta e.g: 1.0 .PARAMETER MsGraphHost The MS Graph API Host Default: graph.microsoft.com .PARAMETER ClientID This is the Azure AD App Registration Client ID .PARAMETER ClientSecret This is the Azure AD App Registration Client Secret .PARAMETER TenantId Your Azure Tenant ID .PARAMETER Hash This parameter is to be used if you want to import a specific hash from either a file or copying and pasting from an application. .PARAMETER GroupTag This Parameter is to be used if you want to Tag your devices with a specific group tag. .EXAMPLE .\\Enroll_to_Autopliot_Unattended.ps1 -ClientID \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Your Client ID\u0026gt;\u0026#34; -Client Secret \u0026#34;\u0026lt;YourClientSecret\u0026gt;\u0026#34; -TenantID \u0026#34;\u0026lt;YourTenantID\u0026gt;\u0026#34; This will enroll the device it is running on to Autopilot, Please note this will need to be done as an administrator .EXAMPLE .\\Enroll_to_Autopliot_Unattended.ps1 -ClientID \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Your Client ID\u0026gt;\u0026#34; -Client Secret \u0026#34;\u0026lt;YourClientSecret\u0026gt;\u0026#34; -TenantID \u0026#34;\u0026lt;YourTenantID\u0026gt;\u0026#34; -GroupTag \u0026#34;Sales Device\u0026#34; This will enroll the device it is running on to Autopilot with a Group Tag of Sales Device, Please note this will need to be done as an administrator .EXAMPLE .\\Enroll_to_Autopliot_Unattended.ps1 -ClientID \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Your Client ID\u0026gt;\u0026#34; -Client Secret \u0026#34;\u0026lt;YourClientSecret\u0026gt;\u0026#34; -TenantID \u0026#34;\u0026lt;YourTenantID\u0026gt;\u0026#34; -Hash \u0026#34;\u0026lt;A Hash\u0026gt;\u0026#34; This will enroll the inputed deivce Hash to Autopilot, this can be done against a group of CSV files etc. #\u0026gt; param( [Parameter(DontShow = $true)] [string] $MsGraphVersion = \u0026#34;beta\u0026#34;, [Parameter(DontShow = $true)] [string] $MsGraphHost = \u0026#34;graph.microsoft.com\u0026#34;, #The AzureAD ClientID (Application ID) of your registered AzureAD App [string] $ClientID = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;YourClientID\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, #The Client Secret for your AzureAD App [string] $ClientSecret = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;YourSecret\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, #Your Azure Tenent ID [string] $TenantId = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;YourTenant\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, [string] $Hash, [string] $GroupTag ) Begin { #Create the body of the Authentication of the request for the OAuth Token $Body = @{client_id=$ClientID;client_secret=$ClientSecret;grant_type=\u0026#34;client_credentials\u0026#34;;scope=\u0026#34;https://$MSGraphHost/.default\u0026#34;;} #Get the OAuth Token $OAuthReq = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri \u0026#34;https://login.microsoftonline.com/$TenantId/oauth2/v2.0/token\u0026#34; -Body $Body #Set your access token as a variable $global:AccessToken = $OAuthReq.access_token } Process { if(!$Hash) { $session = New-CimSession # Get the common properties.

MEMCM is great at pulling through the Param block parameters, all we need to do is amend the ClientID, ClientSecret and TenantId arguments as below. When finished click Next review the settings and then click next and then close.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to Approve your Script\nNow choose your victim\u0026hellip; erm I mean client computer from Assets and Compliance \u0026gt; Devices. Right click on the object and select Run Script, Select the script object you created and review the details and then let the script run :D. This can take about 2/5 minutes, as it keeps a loop going until the device is imported. When the script finishes if you look at the script out put you will see the following;\nIf you notice the last output shows the import status of the device.\nIn a Task Sequence in MEMCM I wont go into how to create the entire Task Sequence for a device rebuild however I will explain how you can use the script to import the device into Autopilot during a Task Sequence weather it be a new one or a current one.\nHead over to Software Library \u0026gt; Operating System \u0026gt; Task Sequences so we can get started.\nI will be using a current Task Sequence for this Demo. There may be a future post on how to create a Task Sequence to re-build your device to a standard OS with Drivers and Import it to Autopilot.\nMy existing Task Sequence looks like this;\nThis is a very basic TS which just boots to Win PE, Installs windows and loads driver packs for VMware Virtual Machines (Only a test TS).\nI no longer want to have to re-build the device and then import it to Autopilot Manually so instead we add the script to the top of the TS as follows.\nClick Add \u0026gt; General \u0026gt; Run Powershell Script Enter a Name and Description for the script Select Enter a PowerShell Script Click Add Script Copy the Script above and paste it into the window and click OK In the Parameters box enter -ClientID \"\" -ClientSecret \"\" -TenantId \"\" Select Bypass under the PowerShell Execution Policy drop-down Your window should then look like this;\nHit Apply and then OK and give it a whirl on your machine (well not yours\u0026hellip; always be sure to test it first :P)\nWhen it runs you will see the following appear (depending on your Task Sequence);\nThe device will then be enrolled into Autopilot;\nWhen the device then reboots after my task sequence I am presented with the expected Autopilot Enrolment window.\nTo Conclude So I have shown two ways of using the script to enroll to Autopilot Unattended, now there is nothing preventing you running this from the command line with the same parameters however if you wanted to do it that way I would definitely look at Michael Niehaus\u0026rsquo; Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo script (See the opening few paragraphs with the links to these) as this does not require an App Registration.\nI did fully test these methods at the time of writing the blog but if you come across any information you think may be wrong then please leave a comment or e-mail me on David@euc365.com.\nI hope this is useful for your needs.\n","image":"https://euc365.com/images/post/enroltoap/featuredImage_hu4a55fcf092277c676faee897c45089d9_131576_460x200_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://euc365.com/enrol-devices-to-autopilot-unattended/","tags":["App Registrations","Graph API","Autopilot"],"title":"Enrol Devices to Autopilot (Unattended)"},{"categories":["Azure"],"contents":"What can you use an Azure App Registration for An Azure App Registration has many uses, in my case I use it mainly for the Microsoft Graph API to perform Intune Configuration Profile backups, List devices, Update local CMDB dynamically and also enrol devices into Autopilot.\nYou will see the vast amount of options you can use for the API when you start adding the API permissions below.\nIf you are also using MEMCM and Co-Managing devices with Intune or you have this Azure Tenant attached this will also be using an Azure App Registration to read user details and use user impersonation.\nHowever as you will notice this guide is focused on using the App Registration with the Microsoft Graph API with Client Secrets.\nFinding what API Permission is required for your Microsoft Graph API Call Each API can have a different set of permissions required to be able to read and/or write data. The best way to find these is by using the Microsoft Graph API Reference Guide.\nOnce you have loaded the API Reference guide, you will notice a list of categories for the API like below.\nFor this post I am using the importedWindowsAutopilotDeviceIdentities API reference which is in the Beta API. You can change what API Reference you are using by using the drop down under the Version header in the left-hand pane.\nIf you browse to Devices and apps \u0026gt; Corporate management \u0026gt; Imported windows autopilot device identity \u0026gt; List, You will see under the prerequisites which permissions that particular API requires as highlighted below.\nI will be using the Application permissions as the App this was created for is unattended\nYou will notice that even though you are only listing devices that the ReadWrite permission is listed in the permission set. If you look closer at the permission table headers you will see it states Permissions (from most to least privileged) meaning that to use the full functionality of this API (such as Create, Delete and Update) you will need the ReadWrite permission, However if you just wanted to list the data you would only need the least amount of privileges which is Read.\nHave a browse around and notice the differences in different categories before moving on.\nCreating the Azure App Registration Head over to the Azure Portal and launch Azure Active Directory.\nFrom the pane on the left select App Registrations, from here you can either choose to use an existing registrations or create one for this specific purpose. I would however recommend that you use a specific one for this purpose, this way the app does not have more permissions than it requires.\nLets get started;\nClick New Registration from the ribbon Give the App a name that represents its purpose and leave the rest as default and click Register From the left pane, select API Permissions, This is where we are going to grant the App the permission to the Microsoft Graph API Select Add a permission from the ribbon, you will see a pop out like the below; Click on Microsoft Graph \u0026gt; Application Permissions In the search box type Service and this will show the permissions we require Click Add Permissions You will then see a orange banner stating that the permissions are being edited and consent will need to be given Click the Grant admin consent for, click Yes on the banner to confirm your would like to grant consent Next we need a client secret... you will need to store this in a safe place as once you click of the page its hides all but a few characters. Click Client \u0026amp; Secrets from the pane on the left Click New Client Secret Specify a description, if you are going to put this in numerous locations and let multiple people use it you could relate it to that team/department. But for this example we will keep it simple. Specify a validity period, you have three options, 1 year, 2 years or never. I would not recommend using the later and would ensure that you have processes in place to review the application When you have added the secret, copy the value as you will need this later. To go with the client secret you will also need the Application (Client) ID and the Directory (tenant) ID. These can be found on the Overview page.\nThe details you have gathered from this article you can use them to perform unattended actions on the Microsoft Graph API and other services. I will be posting some other blog posts which relate to using these details so keep an eye on the blog for interesting ways to use the App Registrations.\n","image":"https://euc365.com/images/post/createazureapp/featuredImage_hu59fdad6db3c4c8c16140cbf07aa02e2c_218680_460x200_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://euc365.com/create_an_azure_app_registration/","tags":["Azure","Azure AD","App Registrations"],"title":"Create an Azure App Registration"},{"categories":["Microsoft Intune","Group Policy"],"contents":"What is an OMA-URI Policy? Meaning: Open Mobile Alliance Uniform Resource Identifier Traditionally when you implement a new piece of software which contains Group Policy Objects (GPO\u0026rsquo;s) to customise the feature of the application you would import the .adml and .admx files into the PolicyDefinitions folder located within SysVol (SYSVOL) for the domain or into the local PolicyDefinitions (C:\\WindowsPolicyDefinitions) folder.\nIf like me you are wanting to move most if not all of your policies to Intune for better MDM (Mobile Device Management) then you can run into a rather complex scenario where you need to ingest the .admx file and then work out how to configure your policies correctly. Now the first time I looked at this I thought \u0026lsquo;Oh man this looks tricky, its a job for later on\u0026rsquo;. However after putting it off for so long I finally dived into it and it turns out it isn\u0026rsquo;t as complicated as it looks.\nThe link to the Microsoft Guide can be found HERE!!, Feel free to head over and check it out. Hopefully this post/guide can help you out when it comes to creating your own.\nImporting your ADMX file For this example we will be using Google Chrome\u0026rsquo;s GPO\u0026rsquo;s, Not because they are simple because each policy has its own complexities but because it will be a common policy people will look to migrate to Intune. The ADMX files can be found on the Chrome for Enterprise Download Page, you can obtain the gpo files only be finding the Manage Chrome Browser section.\nOnce downloaded extract the .zip file and find the Chrome.admx (Normally located within WindowsADMX), Open this in a text editor (Notepad will do fine). Now we will switch over to Intune, From the Endpoint Manager Admin Center Homepage select Devices \u0026gt; Configuration Profiles from the navigation bar. Click Create profile.\nClick Create Profile Select the following and click Create; Enter the name for your profile (i.e Windows - Google Chrome Policy) and any other information you wish to add, click Next Now here is the fun part, Click Add Enter a Name (Use something Descriptive) and Enter a description The OMA-URI Field Should be something like the below ./Vendor/MSFT/Policy/ConfigOperations/ADMXInstall/{AppName}/Policy/{ADMXFileName} Data Type: String Value: Paste the contents of the chrome.admx file Click Add Now Proceed to deploy the policy (I would recommend doing this to a test group first) The above path determines what the OMA-URI is for future policies, for example if you enter ./Vendor/MSFT/Policy/ConfigOperations/ADMXInstall/Chrome/Policy/ChromeAdmx as the OMA-URI for the device import the policies within the ADMX will then be formatted like Chrome~Policy~googlechrome~Startup.\nThe full path for the OMA-URI for the Homepage Setting would be ./{AppName}/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Chrome~Policy~googlechrome~Startup/HomepageLocation. The format of the URI is is {AppName}~{SettingType}~{CategoryandSubCategory}.\nNow the category path may not just be a root category for example the startup settings will look like this Chrome~Policy~googlechrome~Startup to break it down\nAppName: Chrome (Set in the ADMX File Ingest) SettingType: Policy (Set in the ADMX File Ingest) CategoryAndSubCategory: Category: googlechrome Sub Category: Startup Now this may seem complicated at first glance, however do keep reading and I will explain how to obtain the paths and settings.\nFinding and Creating Policies Before we get started, if you haven\u0026rsquo;t already re-open the properties of the policy you created previously. You will also need to open the .admx files in your favourite text editor. Personally I use VSCode as it has syntax highlighting for XML files and many other useful features.\nThis section requires this to be published to a device.\nTo get started Open the Chrome.admx and Chrome.adml (This will be in the language folder i.e. en-US within the .zip file) and launch REGEDIT (Registry Editor).\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get started, within REGEDIT browse to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/PolicyManager/AdmxDefault (There is always a random GUID per device, however this doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a difference to the policy so don\u0026rsquo;t worry), from here if you deployed the Chrome Policy as per the above steps you will see something like the below. (Note: this is showing Google Updates, but we will\nAs mentioned above they are broken down like below, we will be sticking with the Homepage setting which is within the startup category.\nAppName: Chrome SettingType: Policy Categories: Root Category: googlechrome Sub Category: startup Now if you look at the .admx file, you will see the following under the categories section\nAs you can see that this correlates with with policy in the registry, now if you expand the policy within the registry you can see that the HomePage Location settings is created from within there\nThis is the part where you actually need the .admx file. Lets start by explaining why you need to use .admx file. For this example you are not only enabling or disabling a policy but you will be actually specifying a value. When you go to specify this value in Intune you will need to use the ValueName from within the ADMX File. See the below example;\nLets break the policy setting down first, As always I would recommend naming the setting descriptively and also adding a description if you want more information about it. The OMA-URI would then be ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Chrome~Policy~googlechrome~Startup/HomepageLocation.\nClass (Device or User) One things to note here is the first section of the OMA-URI, It seems simple but you will need to specify if you want to apply this to a Device or User. Some policies are only available for Devices and likewise for Users. You can see this in the ADMX File by looking at the policy like below\nNow the HomePageLocation setting can be User or Device based so the class shows as Both. If this was a device only policy class=\u0026ldquo;Machine\u0026rdquo; and for a user only policy it would show as class=\u0026ldquo;User\u0026rdquo;.\nAppName As mentioned above the AppName is can be totally customisable however I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t advise that and I would keep it as simple and descriptive as possible.\nFor example, For this post I used Chrome as the AppName so the Policies show as Chrome~{SettingType}~{Root Category}~{Sub** **Category}. If i was to do another policy for Lenovo Vantage for example and set the AppName to LenovoVantage the polcies would show LenovoVantage~{SettingType}~{Root Category}~{Sub Category}.\nSettingType As we imported the ADMX into the Policy section (./Vendor/MSFT/Policy/ConfigOperations/ADMXInstall/{AppName}/Policy/{ADMXFileName}) of the ADMXInstall OMA-URI this part of the OMA-URI would always be policy.\nCategories and Sub-Categories This is detailed above but I will elaborate a little bit more here.\nIf you look at the .admx file, and browse to the categories section you will see lots of categories set with a parent category within there.\nIf you work backwards you can see how this all comes together,\nThe OMA-URI is Chrome~Policy~{Root Category}~{Sub Category}\nSub Category: Startup Root Category: googlechrome Something to not here is that it is possible for a parent category to have another parent category to make matters more confusing. You could end up having a policy like {AppName}~Policy~{Parent Category 1}~{Parent Category 2}~{Sub Category} and so on\u0026hellip; Just something to always check.\nThis is partly the reason to always check the registry when creating polices.\nThe Policy Itself So finally we come to the policy itself, at the end all the OMA-URI string comes the setting, in this case HomePageLocation.\nThis is derived again from the .admx file, if you search for the policy you will come across something like the above screenshot. You will notice that the policy is based on the DisplayName property. We won\u0026rsquo;t cover setting the value in this section as I feel it deserves its own.\nThe Policy Value/Setting Some setting are really simple to configure, for example if you want to disable something like MetricsReportingEnabled you can simply just add like below\nOthers like the HomePageLocation are not complicated but require a little bit more than just a simple disable or enable switch as you need to specify a value for the property.\nAgain jumping back into the .admx file, if you look at the last highlighted section of the below screenshot you can see that there is a ValueName, now this is the value we need want to change.\nto do this you would need to write the policy string like the below screenshot\nIf you look at the data id section, this is where you would put the value name in out of the .admx file, from there you would then set the value of that property for example https://euc365.com.\nIf you apply this policy and sync it to your device you will notice that it will change the Homepage upon start up.\nNow\u0026hellip; Here is another example of adding a string to a policy which requires multiple values. This once is not so much tricky but its messy.\nFor this example we will use the Allow Pop ups for certain sites, I will start off by showing you the screenshot of the policy itself\nYou will notice that at the start and end of each URL there is a rather ugly looking set of characters, now this is where is can get messy. The pre-URL string is the only one that needs to be changed per entry. If you think of this like a list, option 1 in the list is http://euc365.com and option 2 is http://bbc.co.uk, As you can see in the screenshot the pre-URL has a number which needs to be incremented each time you add another URL.\nIf you are just having one URL you don’t need to add the final \u0026amp;#xF000;, However if you are using multiple values you will need to add that to the end of the URL and then follow it up with you next URL.\nThe last URL in the sequence should not be followed by \u0026amp;#xF000;\nLooking at putting the URL together you will end up with something like 1\u0026amp;#xF000; + https://euc365.com + \u0026amp;#xF000; + Following URLs, For a single url it would be 1\u0026amp;#xF000; + https://euc365.com\n","image":"https://euc365.com/images/post/omauri/chromeadmx-300x208_hu9ed1ef16713ef4b381fc8134635f7fa9_21756_460x200_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://euc365.com/breaking-custom-oma-uri-csp-policies/","tags":["Intune","Configuration Profiles","Group Policy"],"title":"Breaking Down Custom OMA-URI (CSP) Policies"},{"categories":["PowerShell","Community Tools"],"contents":"SO\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ve been working tirelessly in trying to get an Autopilot Hybrid Deployment working along with my colleagues.
